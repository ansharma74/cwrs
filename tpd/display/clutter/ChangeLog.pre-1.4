    animator: fix removal of all keys
    
    When removing all keys in a ClutterAnimator, the hash table with
    object/property name pairs went out of sync. This change makes
    the animator always clear this hash table upon key-removal; and
    refreshing it if the animator's timeline is running.
    
    Fixes bug #2335

    material: Don't prune ancestry if it owns some layers
    
    Each time a material property changes we look to see if any of its
    ancestry has become redundant and if so we prune that redundant
    ancestry.
    
    There was a problem with the logic that handles this though because we
    weren't considering that a material which is a layer state authority may
    still defer to ancestors to define the state of individual layers.
    
    For example a material that derives from a parent with 5 layers can
    become a STATE_LAYERS authority by simply changing it's ->n_layers count
    to 4 and in that case it can still defer to its ancestors to define the
    state of those 4 layers.
    
    This patch checks first if a material is a layer state authority and if
    so only tries to prune its ancestry if it also *owns* all the individual
    layers it depends on. (I.e. if g_list_length
    (material->layer_differences) != material->n_layers then it's not safe
    to try pruning its ancestry!)

    cookbook: Recipe for "moving actors"
    
    This recipe explains how to use the three animation
    approaches (implicit, State, Animator) to animate movement
    of actors.
    
    Includes some guidelines about which approach to use when, with
    a full code example for each approach.
    
    The discussion section covers some subtleties around animated
    movement; namely: moving actors out of their containers; anchor
    points and movement; moving in the depth axis; interactions
    between animated movement and constraints.

    cookbook: Example of animated movement with ClutterState
    
    Added an example showing how to move two actors between
    two states (one minimised, one maximised) using ClutterState
    to do the movement. Also shows how movement can be mixed
    with other animation (in this case, scaling).

    This adds a check in clutter_actor_real_queue_redraw after calling
    _clutter_actor_get_stage_internal to check in case the actor doesn't yet
    have an associated stage so we can avoid passing a NULL stage pointer to
    _clutter_stage_set_pick_buffer_valid which could cause a crash.

    table-layout: Invert row/column in arguments
    
                    *** This is an API change ***
    
    The general pattern for axis-aligned arguments is:
    
            x argument
            y argument
    
    If we consider columns an x-aligned argument, and row a y-aligned
    argument, then we need to update the TableLayout functions to be:
    
            column
            row
    
    and not:
    
            row
            column

    picking: Fix tracking of pick buffer validity
    
    We have an optimization to track when there are multiple picks per
    frame so we can do a full render of the pick buffer to reduce the
    number of pick renders for a static scene.
    
    There was a problem though in that we were tracking this information in
    the ClutterMainContext, but conceptually this doesn't really make sense
    because the pick buffer is associated with a stage framebuffer and there
    can be multiple stages for one context.
    
    This patch moves the state tracking to ClutterStage.

    This reverts commit d7e86e26960f4cb2f5f0600357f5df89bd1c46c1.
    
    This was a half baked patch that was pushed a bit early since it broke
    test-texture-pick-with-alpha + the commit message refers to a change on
    the wip/paint-box branch that hasn't happened yet.

    picking: Fix tracking of pick buffer validity
    
    We have an optimization to track when there are multiple picks per
    frames so we can do a full render of the pick buffer to reduce the
    number of pick renders for a static scene.
    
    There were two problems with how we were tracking this state though.
    Firstly we were tracking this information in the ClutterMainContext, but
    conceptually this doesn't really make sense because the pick buffer is
    associated with a stage framebuffer and there can be multiple stages for
    one context.  Secondly - since the change to how redraws are queued - we
    weren't marking the pick buffer as invalid when a queuing a redraw, we
    were only marking the buffer invalid when signaling/finishing the
    queue-redraw process, which is now deferred until just before a paint.
    This meant using clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos after a scenegraph
    change could give a wrong result if it just read from an existing (but
    technically invalid) pick buffer.
    
    This patch moves the state tracking to ClutterStage, and ensures the
    buffer is invalidated in _clutter_stage_queue_actor_redraw.

    test-conform: Delay initializing Clutter until a test is run
    
    Instead of calling clutter_init immediately, test-conformance now only
    calls it as part of test_conform_simple_fixture_setup. The conformance
    tests assert that only one test is run per instance of
    test-conformance so it should never end up calling clutter_init
    twice. Delaying clutter_init has the advantage that calling
    "test-conformance -l" will still work even on systems with no X
    server. This could be useful for automated build systems.

    clutter-box-layout: Swap the default request mode
    
    The request mode set by the box layout was previously width-for-height
    in a vertical layout and height-for-width in a horizontal layout which
    seems to be wrong. For example, if width-for-height is used in a
    vertical layout then the width request will come second with the
    for_height parameter set. However a vertical layout doesn't pass the
    for_height parameter on to its children so doing the requests in that
    order doesn't help. If the layout contains a ClutterText then both the
    width and height request for it will have -1 for the for_width and
    for_height parameters so the text would end up allocated too small.

    cookbook: Add recipe about sync'ing actor sizes
    
    The recipe covers how to use ClutterBindConstraint
    to bind actor sizes together.
    
    It gives some examples of where this approach is appropriate,
    as well as explaining an alternative using allocation-changed
    or notify::* signals.
    
    Three examples are given:
    
    1. Resizing a texture to the stage.
    2. Resizing a rectangle to act as a transparent overlay on
    top of a texture (using constraints).
    3. Resizing a rectangle to act as a transparent overlay on
    top of a texture, but with a size proportional to the texture
    (using a handler connected to allocation-changed signals
    emitted by the texture).

    cookbook: Example of using a bind constraint for an overlay
    
    Example code which loads an image into a texture, and resizes
    the image in response to +/- key presses. The overlay is
    a transparent rectangle which is bound to the height and
    width of the texture; on clicking the texture, the overlay
    is made visible by increasing its opacity.
    
    This demonstrates how to use constraints to simplify code
    for resizing an actor which is "dependent" on another actor.

    Instead of using the fixed position and size API, use the newly added
    update_allocation() virtual function in ClutterConstraint to change the
    allocation of a ClutterActor. This allows using constraints inside
    layout managers, and also allows Constraints to react to changes in the
    size of an actor without causing relayout cycles.

    In line with the changes made in f5f066df9ce7 to clean up how Clutter
    deals with transformations of actors this patch updates the code in
    clutter-offscreen-effect.c. We now query the projection matrix from the
    stage instead of the perspective and instead of duplicating the logic to
    setup the stage view transform we now use
    _clutter_actor_apply_modelview_transform for the stage instead.

    cogl: Make cogl_util_next_p2 internal and fix the documentation
    
    cogl_util_next_p2 is declared in cogl-util.h which is a private header
    so it shouldn't be possible for an application to use it. It's
    probably not a function we'd like to export from Cogl so it seems
    better to keep it private. This patch renames it to _cogl_util_next_p2
    so that it won't be exported from the shared library.
    
    The documentation for the function is also slightly wrong because it
    stated that the function returned the next power greater than
    'a'. However the code would actually return 'a' if it's already a
    power of two. I think the actual behaviour is more useful so this
    patch changes the documentation rather than the code.

    cogl-vertex-buffer: Don't always set COGL_MATERIAL_FLUSH_FALLBACK_MASK
    
    Previously CoglVertexBuffer would always set the flush options flags
    to at least contain COGL_MATERIAL_FLUSH_FALLBACK_MASK. The code then
    later checks whether any flags are set before deciding whether to copy
    the material to implement the overrides. This means that it would
    always end up copying the material even if there are no fallback
    layers. This patch changes it so that it only sets
    COGL_MATERIAL_FLUSH_FALLBACK_MASK if fallback_layers != 0.

    material-arbfp: fix updating params if sharing progs
    
    If a single arbfp program is being shared between multiple CoglMaterials
    then we need to make sure we update all program.local params when
    switching between materials. Previously we had a dirty flag to track
    when combine_constant params were changed but didn't take in to account
    that different materials sharing the same program may have different
    combine constants.

    material-arbfp: Another pass at simplifying the code
    
    Previously the backend private state was used to either link to an
    authority material or provide authoritative program state. The mechanism
    seemed overly complex and felt very fragile. I made a recent comment
    which added a lot of documentation to make it easier to understand but
    still it didn't feel very elegant.
    
    This patch takes a slightly different approach; we now have a
    ref-counted ArbfpProgramState object which encapsulates a single ARBfp
    program and the backend private state now just has a single member which
    is a pointer to one of these arbfp_program_state objects. We no longer
    need to cache pointers to our arbfp-authority and so we can get rid of
    a lot of awkward code that ensured these pointers were
    updated/invalidated at the right times. The program state objects are
    not tightly bound to a material so it will also allow us to later
    implement a cache mechanism that lets us share state outside a materials
    ancestry. This may help to optimize code not following the
    recommendations of deriving materials from templates, avoiding one-shot
    materials and not repeatedly modifying materials because even if a
    material's ancestry doesn't naturally lead us to shareable state we can
    fallback to searching for shareable state using central hash tables.

    material: Adds experimental cogl_material_foreach_layer API
    
    This adds a way to iterate the layer indices of the given material since
    cogl_material_get_layers has been deprecated. The user provides a
    callback to be called once for each layer.
    
    Because modification of layers in the callback may potentially
    invalidate any number of the internal CoglMaterialLayer structures and
    invalidate the material's layer cache this should be more robust than
    cogl_material_get_layers() which used to return a const GList *
    pointing directly to internal state.

    material-arbfp: don't recompile for constant changes
    
    Instead of lazily incorporating combine constants as arbfp PARAM
    constants in the source directly we now use program.local parameters
    instead so we can avoid repeating codegen if a material's combine
    constant is updated. This should be a big win for applications animating
    a constant used for example in an animated interpolation, such as

    material-arbfp: don't redo codegen for texture changes
    
    This makes it so we don't consider LAYER_STATE_TEXTURE changes to affect
    the arbfp code. This should avoid a lot of unneeded passes of
    code generation for applications modifying the texture for a layer.

    material: make layer/material_pre_changes mutually exclusive
    
    This makes it so we only notify backends of either a single material
    change or a single layer change. Previously all material STATE_LAYERS
    changes would be followed by a more detailed layer change.
    
    For backends that perform code generation for fragment processing they
    typically need to understand the details of how layers get changed to
    determine if they need to repeat codegen. It doesn't help them to report
    a material STATE_LAYERS change for all layer changes since it's so
    broad, they really need to wait for the layer change to be notified.
    
    What does help though is to report a STATE_LAYERS change for a change in
    material->n_layers because they typically do need to repeat codegen in
    that case.

    material-arbfp: fixes for how we track private state
    
    This fixes a number of issues relating to how we track the arbfp private
    state associated with CoglMaterials. At the same time it adds much more
    extensive code documentation to try and make it a bit more approachable.

    material: pass material owner for layer pre changes
    
    When notifying a backend about a layer being modified we now pass the
    layers current owner for reference. NB: Although a layer can indirectly
    be referenced by multiple layers, a layer is considered immutable once
    it has dependants, so there is only ever one material associated with a
    layer being modified. Passing the material pointer to the backends
    layer_pre_change callback can be useful for backends that associate
    their private state with materials and may need to update that state in
    response to layer changes.

    arbfp: rename get_arbfp_authority clarifying semantics
    
    This renames the get_arbfp_authority function to
    get_arbfp_authority_no_check to clarify that the function doesn't
    validate that the authority cache is still valid by looking at the age
    of the referenced material. The function should only be used when we
    *know* the cache has already been checked.

    material: track if material change is layer change
    
    We now pass a boolean to _cogl_material_pre_change_notify to know when
    a material change is as a result of a layer change. We plan to use this
    information to avoid notifying the backends about material changes if
    they are as a result of layer changes. This will simplify the handling
    of state changes in the backends because they can assume that layer and
    material changes are mutually exclusive.

    material: Adds _get_layer_combine_constant API
    
    This adds an internal _cogl_material_get_layer_combine_constant function
    so we can query the current layer combine constant back. We should
    probably make this a public property getter, but for now we just need
    this so we can read the constant in the arbfp backend.

    material: track unit state with arbfp private state
    
    We are going to start tracking more per-texture unit state with arbfp
    private state so this adds an internal UnitState type and we allocate an
    array of these when setting up a new private state structure. The first
    thing that has been moved into this is the sampled boolean to know when
    a particular texture unit gets sampled from in the generated arbfp code.

    Enumeration value should be on the same line
    
    The glib-mkenums script is not clever enough to deal with
    
      FLAGS_VALUE = FLAGS_A |
                    FLAGS_B
    
    And since this breaks the enumeration GType and the introspection data,
    we cannot really wait for it to be fixed.

    profile: Update to uprof-0.3 dep for --enable-profile
    
    When building with --enable-profile we now depend on the uprof-0.3
    developer release which brings a few improvements:
    
    » It lets us "fix" how we initialize uprof so that instead of using a shared
    object constructor/destructor (which was a hack used when first adding
    uprof support to Clutter) we can now initialize as part of clutter's
    normal initialization code. As a side note though, I found that the way
    Clutter initializes has some quite serious problems whenever it
    involves GOptionGroups. It is not able to guarantee the initialization
    of dependencies like uprof and Cogl. For this reason we still use the
    contructor/destructor approach to initialize uprof in Cogl.
    
    » uprof-0.3 provides a better API for adding custom columns when reporting
    timer and counter statistics which lets us remove quite a lot of manual
    report generation code in clutter-profile.c.
    
    » uprof-0.3 provides a shared context for tracking mainloop timer
    statistics. This means any mainloop based library following the same
    "Mainloop" timer naming convention can use the shared context and no
    matter who ends up owning the final mainloop the statistics will always
    be in the same place. This allows profiling of Clutter with an
    external mainloop such as with the Mutter compositor.
    
    » uprof-0.3 can export statistics over dbus and comes with an ncurses
    based ui to vizualize timer and counter stats live.
    
    The latest version of uprof can be cloned from:
    git://github.com/rib/UProf.git

    cogl-framebuffer: Clear the renderbuffer list on failure
    
    When try_creating_fbo fails it deletes any intermediate render buffers
    that were created. However it doesn't clear the list so I think if it
    failed a second time it would try to delete the render buffers
    again. This could potentially cause problems if a subsequent fbo is
    created because the destructor for the original might delete the
    renderbuffers of the new fbo.

    clone: scale src with apply_transform not cogl_scale
    
    Since a ClutterClone may be allocated a different size than its source
    actor we need to apply a scale factor before painting the source actor.
    We were manually using cogl_scale to do this in clutter_clone_paint but
    really this kind of thing is best handled in an implementation of the
    apply_transform virtual so Clutter can be aware of the transform for
    other purposes, such as input transformations. Also we want to provide
    an implementation of the get_paint_volume virtual where Clutter will
    also expect to be able to use the apply_transform virtual to transform
    the volume into its parent's coordinate space.

    glx: Mark stage clip initialized even for NULL user clip
    
    If a NULL clip is passed to clutter_stage_glx_add_redraw_clip then we
    update the redraw clip to have width of 0, but we weren't setting
    stage_glx->initialized_redraw_clip = TRUE. This could result in a full,
    unclipped stage redraw being reduced to a clipped redraw.

    actor: warn if allocating actor not descending from stage
    
    This adds a verbose warning that will be displayed if
    clutter_actor_allocate is passed an actor that isn't a descendent of a
    ClutterStage. Layouting should always bubble up from a stage so this
    condition is likely to indicate a buggy container that allocating a
    child that it has already unparented.

    Try to clean up how we handle actor transformations
    
    When building actor relative transforms, instead of using the matrix
    stack to combine transformations and making assumptions about what is
    currently on the stack we now just explicitly initialize an identity
    matrix and apply transforms to that.
    
    This removes the full_vertex_t typedef for internal transformation code
    and we just use ClutterVertex.
    
    ClutterStage now implements apply_transform like any other actor now
    and the code we had in _cogl_setup_viewport has been moved to the
    stage's apply_transform instead.
    
    ClutterStage now tracks an explicit projection matrix and viewport
    geometry. The projection matrix is derived from the perspective whenever
    that changes, and the viewport is updated when the stage gets a new
    allocation. The SYNC_MATRICES mechanism has been removed in favour of
    _clutter_stage_dirty_viewport/projection() APIs that get used when
    switching between multiple stages to ensure cogl has the latest
    information about the onscreen framebuffer.

    cookbook: Added a recipe for reusing a complex animation
    
    This recipe explains how to "reuse" the same animation
    definition for different actors, by creating a new
    instance of a "rig" (empty container) and animation
    for the rig each time the animation is required.
    
    An actor is then re-parented to the rig and animated
    using it, rather than being animated directly.
    
    JSON is used to define the rig + animator, to make
    creating new instances of them simpler. The recipe
    also discusses various caveats around using this
    approach, rather than directly animating an actor.

    cookbook: Refactored reusable animation example
    
    Extracted the animation into its own JSON definition,
    then create a new script and get the animation each
    time a rectangle is clicked.
    
    Removes the need to reparent onto the background and
    copy property values to the rectangle after the animation,
    and generally much cleaner.

    cookbook: Added example for animation reuse recipe
    
    Added an example showing how to reuse a ClutterAnimator
    instance to animate multiple actors at different times
    using an animatable rig, combined with reparenting.

    cally: fixing public headers
    
    Cally headers were including specific clutter object headers.
    
    This caused a problem including cally.h on a external program.

    build: Generate ClutterJson in the top directory
    
    Instead of doing the shlib trick, build ClutterJson (if needed) inside
    the top-level clutter/ directory - similar to a non-recursive layout.
    
    Hopefully, one day, we'll be able to do this with a real non-recursive
    layout.

    keysyms: Update the macros to CLUTTER_KEY_*
    
    The keysyms defines in clutter-keysyms.h are generated from the X11 key
    symbols headers by doing the equivalent of a pass of sed from XK_* to
    CLUTTER_*. This might lead to namespace collisions, down the road.
    Instead, we should use the CLUTTER_KEY_* namespace.
    
    This commit includes the script, taken from GDK, that parses the X11
    key symbols and generates two headers:
    
      - clutter-keysyms.h: the default included header, with CLUTTER_KEY_*
      - clutter-keysyms-compat.h: the compatibility header, with CLUTTER_*
    
    The compat.h header file is included if CLUTTER_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is
    not defined - essentially deprecating all the old key symbols.
    
    This does not change any ABI and, assuming that an application or
    library is not compiling with CLUTTER_DISABLE_DEPRECATED, the source
    compatibility is still guaranteed.

    This requires adding -UCLUTTER_DISABLE_DEPRECATED to the introspection

    animation: Allow detaching an animation from an actor
    
    When animating an actor through clutter_actor_animate() and friends we
    might want forcibly detach the animation instance from the actor in
    order to start a new one - for instance, in response to user
    interaction.
    
    Currently, there is no way to do that except in a very convoluted way,
    by emitting the ::completed signal and adding a special case in the
    signal handlers; this is due to the fact that clutter_actor_animate()
    adds more logic than the one added by clutter_animation_set_object(),
    so calling set_object(NULL) or unreferencing the animation instance
    itself won't be enough.
    
    The right way to approach this is to add a new method to Clutter.Actor
    that detaches any eventual Animation currently referencing it.

    cogl-vertex-buffer: Flush the framebuffer state first
    
    Flushing the framebuffer state can cause some drawing to occur if the
    framebuffer has a clip stack which needs the stencil buffer. This was
    causing the array pointers set up by enable_state_for_drawing_buffer
    to get mangled so it would crash when it hits glDrawArrays. This patch
    moves the framebuffer state flush to before it sets up the array
    pointers.

    build: Allow using gettext 0.17
    
    This requires some autotools magic when setting up the environment
    through autogen.sh, because autoreconf does not do the right thing
    by default.
    
    The correct order for setting up localization is:
    
      ‣ autopoint
      ‣ aclocal
      ‣ ...
    
    otherwise aclocal will copy the system's gettext.m4 instead of honouring
    the version we specified with AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION in configure.ac.

    ClutterX11TexturePixmap: Fix unbalanced error trapping
    
    I think this is what commit 2cf140550635 intended to do since it
    specifically mentioned cleaning up the trap in
    clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_set_pixmap, but although it moved the untrap
    to only be done in the case where Pixmap != None it left the position of
    the trap itself unchanged. This meant the error trapping wouldn't be
    balanced if pixmap == None since the untrap wouldn't be done. We now
    only trap and untrap around the XGetGeometry call done when pixmap !=
    None.

    Clean up CoglTexturePixmapX11 first
    
    With currently distributed versions of Mesa, calling XFreePixmap()
    before glxDestroyPixmap() will cause an X error from DRI. So, we
    need to make sure that we get rid of the CoglTexturePixmapX11 before
    we XFreePixmap().
    
    clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_dispose(): Call
     clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_set_pixmap() instead of using XFreePixmap
     directly so that we leverage the text-clearing hack and destroy
     things in the right order.
    
    clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_set_pixmap(): Don't do a pointless roundtrip
     and trap a pointless error when setting pixmap to None.
    
    clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_set_pixmap(): Free damage resources when
     we are setting Pixmap to None.
    
    clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_set_window(): When setting a new window
     or setting the window to None, immedediately  call
     cluter_x11_texture_pixmap_set_pixmap(). This means that set_window(None)
     immediately will free any referenced resources related to the window.

    introspection: Add missing (out) annotations
    
    Comprehensively add (out) annotations to functions parameters
    returning int/float/double.
    
    Not handled here: structure out returns like ClutterColor or
    ClutterPerspective or GValue that should get (out caller-allocates).

    build: Make the generated glib-mkenums c file depend on the headers
    
    What happens now if you rename an enum inside a header:
    
      • glib-mkenums generates the header file
      • a comparison is made with the previous version of the heade is made
        and no difference is found as you don't remove or create enums
      • the compilation of the generated mkenums c file fails because it has
        not been regenerated with the new, renamed, enum.
    
    That's why the generated clutter-enum-types.c needs to depend on the
    headers too.
    
    Of course such scenario should not happen in stable releases as enums
    are part of the API, but renaming enums happens in the development cycle
    and create compilation errors (very annoying when doing git bissects for
    instance).

    drag-action: Added x-drag-threshold and y-drag-threshold properties
    
                    *** This is an API change ***
    
    Replaced the original drag-threshold property with two separate
    horizontal (x-drag-threshold) and vertical (y-drag-threshold)
    thresholds.
    
    It is some times necessary to have different drag thresholds for the
    horizontal and vertical axes. For example, when a draggable actor is
    inside a horizontal scrolling area, only vertical movement must begin
    dragging. That can be achieved by setting the x-drag-threshold to
    G_MAXUINT while y-drag-threshold is something usual, say, 20 pixels.
    
    This is different than drag axis, because after the threshold
    has been cleared by the pointer, the draggable actor can be dragged
    along both axes (if allowed by the drag-axis property).

    texture: Use a base material for all instances
    
    Creating new materials for every Texture instance results in a lot of
    ARBfp programs being generated/compiled. Since most textures will just
    be similar we should create a template material for all of them, and
    then copy it in every instance. Cogl will try to optimize the generation
    of the program and, hopefully, will reuse the same program most of the
    time.
    
    With this change, a simple test shows that loading 48 textures will
    result in just two programs being compiled - with and without batching
    enabled.

    material: Check before unreferencing a texture
    
    When disposing a material layer of type 'texture' we should check that
    the texture handle is still valid before calling cogl_handle_unref().
    This avoids an assertion failure when disposing a ClutterTexture.

    cookbook: Added recipe for complex animation
    
    Uses ClutterAnimator to implement a reasonably complex
    animation of a single actor (movement along a path with
    simultaneous scaling).
    
    Provides a metaphor for thinking about ClutterAnimator
    animations (stage directions) and explains keys and key
    frames in some depth. Also compares ClutterAnimator
    with other possible approaches to this type of animation
    (implicit animations, ClutterState).

    Added another JSON example to show how transitions can

    sequences of 1 transition).
    
    Modified the C JSON loader program so it can be used with
    this example as well.

    build: Allow disabling linking with -Bsymbolic
    
    Some debugging tools might require full visibility for the Clutter
    symbols; for this reason, and to match what the Clutter dependencies
    already allow, we should provide a configure switch to disable linking
    with the -Bsymbolic flag.

    introspection: Build fixes
    
    This patch merges in substantial work from
    Emmanuele Bassi <ebassi@linux.intel.com>
    
    * Use new introspection --include-uninstalled API since we don't want
      to try to find the clutter-1.0.pc file before it's installed.
    * Use --pkg-export for Clutter-1.0.gir, since we want the .gir file to
      contain the associated pkg-config file.
    * Drop the use of --pkg for dependencies; those come from the associated
      .gir files.  (Actually, --pkg is almost never needed)
    * Add --quiet

    egl: Fix the installed headers
    
     • Use the public COGL_HAS_GLES[12] define instead of the HAVE_COGL_*
       ones which are private and defined in config.h,
     • Install clutter-egl-headers.h which is needed by clutter-egl.h,
     • Remove clutter-stage.h as it's uneeded and does not work since the
       single clutter.h include policy,
     • Install the egl headers into their own egl directory as the x11 and
       glx backends do. The include should then be <clutter/egl/clutter-egl.h>,
       so document it. It does not really break anything as nobody could
       have used those broken headers.

    cex100: Add a Clutter EGL backend for CE3100/CE4100 SoCs
    
    Intel CE3100 and CE4100 SoCs are designed for TVs. They have separate
    framebuffers that are blended together by a piece of hardware to make
    the final output. The library that allows you to initialize and
    configure those planes is called GDL. A EGL GDL winsys can then be
    use with those planes as NativeWindowType to select which plane to use.
    
    This patch adds a new ClutterBackendCex100 backend that can be
    selected at compile time with the new --with-flavour=cex100 option.

    offscreen-effect: Rename create_target to create_buffer
    
                    *** This is an API change ***
    
    The create_target() virtual function should return a CoglHandle to a
    texture; clutter_offscreen_effect_get_target(), instead, returns a
    CoglMaterial to be painted in the implementation of the paint_target()
    virtual function.
    
    Instead of equating textures with materials, and confusing the user of
    the API, we should mark the difference more prominently.
    
    First of all, we should return a CoglMaterial* (now that we have that
    as a public type) in get_target(); having handles all over the place
    does not make it easier to distinguish the semantics of the virtual
    functions.
    
    Then we should rename create_target() to create_texture(), to make it
    clear that what should be returned is a texture that is used as the
    backing for the offscreen framebuffer.

    Includes guidelines on writing handlers (i.e. need to use

    which connects a handler for motion events on a rectangle.

    win32: Fix the check for the 'IN_DESTRUCTION' flag
    
    Commit eae45619299 tried to clean how it checks for the private actor
    flags. However the check for the 'IN_DESTRUCTION' flag in the Win32
    backend got inverted so it would always clear the current
    context. This was causing _cogl_check_driver_valid to fail later and
    then the realize would get stuck in a infinite loop.

    Invert the check for whether to clip the pick
    
    In 965907deb3f9e the picking was changed to render the full stage
    instead of a single pixel whenever picking is performed more than once
    between paints. However the condition in the if-statement was
    backwards so it would end up always doing a full stage render.

    cookbook: Added recipe for handling pointer events on an actor
    
    Added a recipe about handling enter, leave, and motion events
    on an actor.
    
    Gives some pointers to data available from motion events,
    explains a bit about stage-relative and actor-relative coords,
    and covers how overlapping actors and reactivity of actors
    can affect events occurring.
    
    Examples include a simple scribble app showing how to integrate
    pointer events into a more useful context.

    Cache a full pick render if we have a static stage
    
    The idea is that if we see multiple picks per frame then that implies
    the visible scene has become static. In this case we can promote the
    next pick render to be unclipped so we have valid pick values for the
    entire stage. Now we can continue to read from this cached buffer until
    the stage contents do visibly change.
    
    Thanks to Luca Bruno on #clutter for this idea!

    cookbook: Added a longer slideshow example
    
    Cross-fading between two images is straightforward,
    but cycling between more than two is more efficient
    if done by copying COGL textures between the
    two textures, rather than trying to reposition the
    textures.
    
    The example demonstrates how to reuse a pair of
    textures to cycle through multiple images.

commit 83a8d0b3bb2ad47db6afd32bd2aa503814486e07
Author: Elliot Smith <elliot.smith@intel.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 12 17:39:59 2010 +0100

    cookbook: Added example code for texture cross-fading
    
    Added simple image viewer which loads image file names
    from a directory, displays the first one, then displays
    the next in the list with each key press. Uses the
    primitive fade front in/fade back out approach.
    
    Also adapted Emmanuele's example code which uses Cogl
    to produce a similar effect, but within a single texture.
    This code loads two images specified on the command
    line and cross-fades between them.

    The tests/accessibility, tests/micro-bench and the examples directory
    in the coobook create a lot of non-installed binaries. Since we know who
    they are, and we ignore them, we can auto-generate the ignore files as
    well.
    
    The rest of Clutter is covered by the main ignore file.

    material: Implements weak materials
    
    Weak materials are ones that don't take a reference on their parent and
    they are associated with a callback that notifies when the material is
    destroyed, because its parent was freed or modified.
    
    More details can be found at:
    http://wiki.clutter-project.org/wiki/CoglDesign/CoglMaterial
    
    For now the concept is internal only but the plan is to make this public
    at some point once we have tested the design internally.

    cogl-shader: get_info_log should always use strdup
    
    In the case where there is no error log for arbfp we were returning a
    "" string literal. The other paths were using g_strdup to return a
    string that could be freed with g_free. This makes the arbfp path return
    g_strdup ("") instead.

    clutter-shader: use cogl_program_set_uniform_xyz API
    
    Instead of using the deprecated cogl_program_uniform_xyz functions we
    now use the cogl_program_set_uniform methods. It looks like this should
    also fix a problem with clutter-shader too in that previously we weren't
    calling cogl_program_use before cogl_program_uniform_xyz so setting
    uniforms would only work while the shader is enabled.

    cogl-program: Adds use_uniform_xyz methods
    
    Instead of exposing an API that provides an OpenGL state machine style
    where you first have to bind the program to the context using
    cogl_program_use() followed by updating uniforms using
    cogl_program_uniform_xyz we now have uniform setter methods that take an
    explicit CoglHandle for the program.
    
    This deprecates cogl_program_use and all the cogl_program_uniform
    variants and provides the following replacements:
        cogl_program_set_uniform_1i
        cogl_program_set_uniform_1f
        cogl_program_set_uniform_int
        cogl_program_set_uniform_float

    cogl-atlas: Verify that the chosen initial size is supported
    
    CoglAtlas chooses a fairly large default initial size of either
    512x512 or 1024x1024 depending on the texture format. There is a
    chance that this size will not be supported on some platforms which
    would be catastrophic for the glyph cache because it would mean that
    it would always fail to put any glyphs in the cache so text wouldn't
    work. To fix this the atlas code now checks whether the chosen initial
    size is supported by the texture driver and if not it will get halved
    until it is supported.

    cogl-atlas: Use _cogl_texture_driver_size_supported
    
    Previously when creating a new rectangle map it would try increasingly
    larger texture sizes until GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE is reached. This is bad
    because it queries state which should really be owned by the texture
    driver. Also GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE is often a conservative estimate so
    larger texture sizes can be used if the proxy texture is queried
    instead.

    cogl-rectangle-map: Record largest gap rather than the remaining space
    
    Previously each node in the rectangle map tree would store the total
    remaining space in all of its children to use as an optimization when
    adding nodes. With this it could skip an entire branch of the tree if
    it knew there could never be enough space for the new node in the
    branch. This modifies that slightly to instead store the largest
    single gap. This allows it to skip a branch earlier because often
    there would be a lot of small gaps which would add up to enough a
    space for the new rectangle, but the space can't be used unless it is
    in a single node.
    
    The rectangle map still needs to keep track of the total remaining
    space for the whole map for the debugging output so this has been
    added back in to the CoglRectangleMap struct. There is a separate
    debugging function to verify this value.

    cogl-atlas: Try the next size when there would be less than 6% waste
    
    Previously when the atlas needs to be migrated it would start by
    trying with the same size as the existing atlas if there is enough
    space for the new texture. However even if the atlas is completely
    sorted there will always be some amount of waste so when the atlas
    needs to grow it would usually end up redundantly trying the same size
    when it is very unlikely to fit. This patch changes it so that there
    must be at least 6% waste available after the new texture is added
    otherwise it will start with the next atlas size.

    cogl-rectangle-map: Use a GArray for the stack
    
    When iterating over the rectangle map a stack is used to implement a
    recursive algorithm. Previously this was slice allocating a linked
    list. Now it uses a GArray which is retained with the rectangle map to
    avoid frequent allocations which is a little bit faster.

    cogl-rectangle-map: Store the remaining space per node
    
    Previously the remaining space was managed as part of the
    CoglRectangleMap struct. Now it is stored per node so that at any
    point in the hierarchy we can quickly determine how much space is
    remaining in all of the node's children. That way when adding a
    rectangle we can miss out entire branches more quickly if we know that
    there is no way the new rectangle would fit in that branch.
    
    This also adds a function to recursively verify the cached state in
    the nodes such as the remaining space and the number of
    rectangles. This function is only called when the dump-atlas-image
    debug flag is set because it is potentially quite slow.

    cogl-atlas: Increase the default minimum texture size
    
    When initially creating a texture it would start with a minimum size
    of 256x256. This increases the size so that it would try to match 1MB

    cogl-pango: Use a CoglAtlas to maintain the glyph cache
    
    The glyph cache is now stored in a CoglAtlas structure instead of the
    custom atlasing code. This has the advantage that it can share code
    with the main texture atlas and that it supports reorganizing the
    atlas when it becomes full. Unlike the texture atlas, the glyph cache
    can use multiple atlases which would be neccessary if the maximum
    texture size is reached and we need to create a second
    texture. Whenever a display list is created it now has to register a
    callback with the glyph cache so that the display list can be
    recreated whenever any of the atlases are reorganized. This is needed
    because the display list directly stores texture coordinates within
    the atlas texture and they would become invalid when the texture is
    moved.
    
    The ensure_glyphs_for_layout now works in two steps. First it reserves
    space in the atlas for all of the glyphs. The atlas is created with
    the DISABLE_MIGRATION flag so that it won't actually copy any textures
    if any rearranging is needed. Whenever the position is updated for a
    glyph then it is marked as dirty. After space for all of the glyphs
    has been reserved it will iterate over all dirty glyphs and redraw
    them using Cairo. The rendered glyph is then stored in the texture
    with a sub texture update.
    
    The glyphs need to all be set at the right location before starting to
    create the display list because the display list stores the texture
    coordinates of the glyph. If any of the glyphs were moved around then
    the parts of the display list that was created already would become
    invalid. To make this work, ensure_glyphs_for_layout is now always
    called before rendering a layout or a layout line.

    cogl-atlas: Support multiple formats and clearing the texture
    
    _cogl_atlas_new now has two extra parameters to specify the format of
    the textures it creates as well as a set of flags to modify the
    behavious of the atlas. One of the flags causes the new textures to be
    cleared and the other causes migration to avoid actually copying the
    textures. This is needed to use CoglAtlas from the pango glyph cache
    because it needs to use COGL_PIXEL_A_8 and to clear the textures as it
    does not fill in the gaps between glyphs. It needs to avoid copying
    the textures so that it can work on GL implementations without FBO
    support.

    Textures within a layer were compared for equality by comparing their
    texture handle. However this means that sub textures and atlas
    textures which may be internally using the same GL handle would not be

    handle using either the slice override or _cogl_texture_get_gl_texture
    and then compares those.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Accept formats with different component orders
    
    When filtering on allowed formats for atlas textures, it now masks out
    the BGR and AFIRST bits in addition to the premult bit. That way it
    will accept RGB and RGBA formats in any component order.
    
    In theory it could also accept luminance and alpha-only textures but I
    haven't added this because presumably if the application has requested
    these formats then it has some reason not to use a full RGB or RGBA
    texture and we should respect that.

    Since BlurEffect and DesaturateEffect are using the shader API

    blur-effect: Do not inherit from ShaderEffect
    
    We might want to switch the BlurEffect from a box-blur to a
    super-sampling of the texture target, in order to make it cheap(er).
    If we inherit from ShaderEffect, though, we're setting in stone the
    fact that we are going to use a fragment shader for blurring.
    
    Since there is not parametrization of the blur, the code necessary
    to implement effect is pretty small, and we can use the Cogl API
    directly.

    Add ClutterTableLayout, a layout showing children in rows and columns
    
    A TableLayout is a layout manager that allocates its children in rows
    and columns. Each child is assigned to a cell (or more if a cell span
    is set).
    
    The supported child properties are:
    
      • x-expand and y-expand: if this cell with try to allocate the
        available extra space for the table.
      • x-fill and y-fill: if the child will get all the space available in
        the cell.
      • x-align and y-align: if the child does not fill the cell, then
        where the child will be aligned inside the cell.
      • row-span and col-span: number of cells the child will allocate for
        itself.
    
    Also, the TableLayout has row-spacing and col-spacing for specifying
    the space in pixels between rows and between columns.
    
    We also include a simple test of the layout manager, and the
    documentation updates.
    
    The TableLayout was implemented starting from MxTable and
    ClutterBoxLayout.

    actor: Add allocate_align_fill()
    
    Layout managers are using the same code to allocate a child while taking
    into consideration:
    
      • horizontal and vertical alignment
      • horizontal and vertical fill
      • the preferred minimum and natural size, depending
        on the :request-mode property
      • the text direction for the horizontal alignment
      • an offset given by the fixed position properties
    
    Given the amount of code involved, and the amount of details that can go
    horribly wrong while copy and pasting such code in various classes - let
    alone various projects - Clutter should provide an allocate() variant
    that does the right thing in the right way. This way, we have a single
    point of failure.

    Conditionally use g_object_notify_by_pspec
    
    This adds a wrapper macro to clutter-private that will use
    g_object_notify_by_pspec if it's compiled against a version of GLib
    that is sufficiently new. Otherwise it will notify by the property
    name as before by extracting the name from the pspec. The objects can
    then store a static array of GParamSpecs and notify using those as
    suggested in the documentation for g_object_notify_by_pspec.
    
    Note that the name of the variable used for storing the array of
    GParamSpecs is obj_props instead of properties as used in the
    documentation because some places in Clutter uses 'properties' as the
    name of a local variable.
    
    Mose of the classes in Clutter have been converted using the script in
    the bug report. Some classes have not been modified even though the
    script picked them up as described here:
    
    json-generator:
    
     We probably don't want to modify the internal copy of JSON
    
    behaviour-depth:
    rectangle:
    score:
    stage-manager:
    
     These aren't using the separate GParamSpec* variable style.
    
    blur-effect:
    win32/device-manager:
    
     Don't actually define any properties even though it has the enum.
    
    box-layout:
    flow-layout:
    
      Have some per-child properties that don't work automatically with
      the script.
    
    clutter-model:
    
      The script gets confused with ClutterModelIter
    
    stage:
    
      Script gets confused because PROP_USER_RESIZE doesn't match
      "user-resizable"
    
    test-layout:
    
      Don't really want to modify the tests

    Always bind a new texture to unit 1 when necessary
    
    The special handling for texture unit 1 caught the case where unit
    1 was changed for transient purposes, but didn't properly handle
    the case where the actual non-transient texture was different between
    two materials with no transient binding in between.
    
    If the actual texture has changed when flushing, mark unit 1 as dirty
    and needing a rebind.

    tests-interactive: Adds a test-cogl-shader-glsl.c
    
    This is based on test-shader.c but is solely implemented with the
    cogl_program/shader APIs instead of the clutter shader APIs.

    tests/interactive: Adds a test-cogl-shader-arbfp.c
    
    This tests the ARBfp support for cogl_program and cogl_shader using the
    shaders Chris Lord adapted from test-shader when he was experimenting
    with adding ARBfp support to clutter back in 2008 (See:
    http://bugzilla.clutter-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1049)

    cogl: Allow setting ARBfp source on a CoglShader
    
    This makes CoglProgram/Shader automatically detect when the user has
    given an ARBfp program by checking for "!!ARBfp1.0" at the beginning of
    the user's source.
    
    ARBfp local parameters can be set with cogl_program_uniform_float
    assuming you pass a @size of 4 (all ARBfp program.local parameters
    are vectors of 4 floats).
    
    This doesn't expose ARBfp environment parameters or double precision
    local parameters.

    material: Add cogl_material_{get,set}_user_program
    
    Previously we had an internal only _cogl_material_set_user_program to
    redirect legacy usage of cogl_program_use() through CoglMaterial. This
    instead makes the API public because until we implement our planned
    "snippet" framework we need a stop-gap solution for using shaders in
    Cogl.
    
    The plan is to also support ARBfp with the cogl_program/shader API so
    this API will also allow clutter-gst to stop using direct OpenGL calls
    that conflict with Cogl's state tracking.

    material: chain up in layer_pre_change_notify
    
    A change to a layer is also going to be a change to its owning material
    so we have to chain up in _cogl_material_layer_pre_change_notify and
    call _cogl_material_pre_change_notify. Previously we were only
    considering if the owning material was referenced in the journal but
    that ignores that it might also have dependants. We no longer need to
    flush the journal directly in layer_pre_change_notify.

    material: unlink old layer from owner when replacing
    
    In _cogl_material_layer_pre_change_notify when we see that a layer has
    dependants and it can't be modified directly then we allocate a new
    layer. In this case we also have to link the new layer to its required
    owner. If the immutable layer we copied had the same owner though we
    weren't unlinking that old layer.

    material: fix initialization of sparse properties
    
    In _cogl_material_pre_change_notify we need to identify if it's a sparse
    property being changed and if so initialize the state group if the given
    material isn't currently the authority for it.
    
    Previously we were unconditionally calling
    _cogl_material_initialize_state which would e.g. NULL the layer
    differences list of a material each time a layer change was notified.
    
    It would also call _cogl_material_initialize_state for non-sparse
    properties which should always be valid at this point so the function
    has been renamed to _cogl_material_initialize_sparse_state to make this
    clearer with a corresponding g_return_if_fail check.

    material: fix copying of material layer differences
    
    This fixes how we copy layer differences in
    _cogl_material_copy_layer_differences.
    
    We were making a redundant g_list_copy of the src differences and then
    iterating the src list calling _cogl_material_add_layer_difference for
    each entry which would double the list length, but the initial copy
    directly referenced the original layers which wasn't correct.
    
    Also we were initializing dest->n_layers before copying the layer
    differences but the act of copying the differences will re-initialize
    n_layers to 0 when adding the first layer_difference since it will
    trigger a layer_pre_change_notify and since the dest material isn't yet
    a STATE_LAYERS authority the state group is initialized before allowing
    the change.

    material: don't dereference layer->texture directly
    
    In _cogl_material_texture_storage_change_notify we were potentially
    dereferencing layer->texture without checking first that it is the
    authority of texture state. We now use
    _cogl_material_layer_get_texture() instead.

    glx: Depend on libdrm
    
    DRM is available on more platforms than Linux (e.g. kFreeBSD), but
    Clutter currently FTBFS there because of not being an alternative to

    Instead of copying the DRM data structures, we should use libdrm when
    falling back to directly requesting to wait for the vblank.

    cogl-material: Unref the texture when reverting authority
    
    When the texture is set on a layer so that it is back to the parent's
    texture it would clear the texture change flag but it wouldn't unref
    the texture. The free function for a material layer does not unref the
    texture if the change flag is cleared so the texture would end up
    leaking. This happens for ClutterTexture because it disposes the
    texture by setting layer 0 of the material to COGL_INVALID_HANDLE
    which ends up the same as the default material.

    layout-manager: Freeze ::layout-changed when creating LayoutMeta
    
    LayoutMeta instances are created lazily. If an actor is added to a
    container with a layout manager then the first time the layout manager
    might be creating the LayoutMeta instance could be during the allocation
    cycle caused by calling clutter_actor_show(). When a LayoutMeta is
    instantiated for the first time, a list of properties can be set - and
    this might lead to the emission of the ::layout-changed signal. The
    signal is, most typically, going to cause a relayout to be queued, and a
    warning will be printed on the terminal.
    
    We should freeze the emission of the ::layout-changed signal during the
    creation of the LayoutMeta instances, and thaw it after that.

    texture: Update the request mode depending on the size
    
    If a Texture has been set to:
    
      • keep its size synchronized with the image data
      • maintain the aspect ratio of the image data
    
    then it should also change its request mode depending on the orientation
    of the image data, so that layout managers have a fighting chance of
    sizing it correctly.

    osx: Fixed stage resize policy
    
    Added initialization of minimum window size property on Cocoa
    side. This property works when user change window size by mouse
    dragging. But when size is changed by clutter_actor_set_size this
    property will not help and was added another check in
    clutter_stage_osx_resize. Also osx_get_geometry was refactoried
    because it returns incorrect values in many cases but now size is
    saved in [Window reshape] in requisition_width/height and this value
    will be returned in any case to frontend.

    docs: Clarify the event retrieval disable behaviour
    
    When we disable the event retrieval, we now just disable the X11 event
    source, not the event selection. We need to make that clear to
    applications, especially compositors, which might expect complete
    control over the selection.

    glx: Unconditionally select X11/GLX events
    
    Currently, we select input events and GLX events conditionally,
    depending on whether the user has disabled event retrieval.
    
    We should, instead, unconditionally select input events even with event
    retrieval disabled because we need to guarantee that the Clutter
    internal state is maintained when calling clutter_x11_handle_event()
    without requiring applications or embedding toolkits to select events
    themselves. If we did that, we'd have to document the events to be
    selected, and also update applications and embedding toolkits each time
    we added a new mask, or a new class of events - something that's clearly
    not possible.
    
    See:
    
      http://bugzilla.clutter-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=998
    
    for the rationale of why we did conditional selection. It is now clear
    that a compositor should clear out the input region, since it cannot
    assume a perfectly clean slate coming from us.
    
    See:
    
      http://bugzilla.clutter-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2228
    
    for an example of things that break if we do conditional event
    selection on GLX events. In that specific case, the X11 server ≤ 1.8
    always pushed GLX events on the queue, even without selecting them; this
    has been fixed in the X11 server ≥ 1.9, which means that applications
    like Mutter or toolkit integration libraries like Clutter-GTK would stop
    working on recent Intel drivers providing the GLX_INTEL_swap_event
    extension.
    
    This change has been tested with Mutter and Clutter-GTK.

    gl2ext.h can't always be used standalone.

    animatable: Allow passing a NULL animation
    
    The Animatable interface was created specifically for the Animation
    class. It turns out that it might be fairly useful to others - such as
    ClutterAnimator and ClutterState.
    
    The newly-added API in this cycle for querying and accessing custom
    properties should not require that we pass a ClutterAnimation to the
    implementations: the Animatable itself should be enough.
    
    This is necessary to allow language bindings to wrap
    clutter_actor_animate() correctly and do type validation and
    demarshalling between native values and GValues; an Animation instance
    is not available until the animate() call returns, and validation must
    be performed before that happens.
    
    There is nothing we can do about the animate_property() virtual
    function - but in that case we might want to be able to access the
    animation from an Animatable implementation to get the Interval for
    the property, just like ClutterActor does in order to animate
    ClutterActorMeta objects.

    x11: Split out conditions and warnings
    
    XGetGeometry is a great piece of API, since it gets a lot of stuff that
    are moderately *not* geometry related - the root window, and the depth
    being two.
    
    Since we have multiple conditions depending on the result of that call
    we should split them up depending on the actual error - and each of them
    should have a separate error message. This makes debugging simpler.

    cookbook: Added recipe for animated rotation of an actor
    
    New recipe covering how to animate rotation of
    an actor (in all axes).
    
    Covers various factors affecting rotation animation
    (like orientation of axes, parent rotation/orientation),
    as well as trying to make rotations easier to visualise
    (e.g. describing how rotation direction is affected by
    those factors, how a rotation can be expected to look
    when animated). Uses implicit animations for code examples.
    
    Also refers to a full code example which uses ClutterState.

    configure.ac: Fix the missing COGL_HAS_GLES[12] defines
    
    In 7fae8ac051 the two cogl-defines.h files from GLES and GL were
    unified. However this missed out the COGL_HAS_GLES[12] defines from
    GLES. The configure.ac still made an AC_SUBST for the right version
    but the replacement was never put in any headers. This fixes it so
    that instead of directly calling AC_SUBST the value is now put into a
    variable which later gets added to COGL_DEFINES so that it will end up
    in cogl-defines.h

    Fix a small typo in configure.ac for the COGL_DEFINES variable
    
    There was an initializer for the COGL_DEFINES variable which sets it
    to the empty value before it is filled in. The name of the variable
    wasn't spelt right so it wouldn't work properly. This doesn't really
    matter because it would default to empty anyway.

    test-shader: The tex_coord varying is now an array under GLES2
    
    Since the GLES2 wrapper grew support for multi-texturing, the
    tex_coord varying variable defined in the vertex shader is actually an
    array of texture coordinates so it ought to match in the fragment
    shader in test-shader. This seemed to work anyway under Mesa/Intel but
    under NVidia it does not so I don't think it's safe to assume that
    linking a non-array varying with an array will work.

    cogl-bitmap-pixbuf: Avoid copying the buffer in more circumstances
    
    When loading an RGB image GdkPixbuf will pad the rowstride so that the
    beginning of each row is aligned to 4 bytes. This was causing us to
    fallback to the code that copies the buffer. It is probably safe to
    avoid copying the buffer if we can detect that the rowstride is simply
    an alignment of the packed rowstride.
    
    This also changes the copying fallback code so that it uses the
    aligned rowstride. However it is now extremely unlikely that the
    fallback code would ever be used.

    cogl-bitmap-pixbuf: Fix the rowstride used when copying a GdkPixbuf
    
    In commit b780413e5ae4b the GdkPixbuf loading code was changed so that
    if it needs to copy the pixbuf then it would tightly pack it. However
    it was still using the rowstride from the pixbuf so the image would
    end up skewed. This fixes it to use the real rowstride.

    cogl-material: Don't map the shininess value to [0,1]
    
    In OpenGL the 'shininess' lighting parameter is floating point value
    limited to the range 0.0→128.0. This number is used to affect the size
    of the specular highlight. Cogl materials used to only accept a number
    between 0.0 and 1.0 which then gets multiplied by 128.0 before sending
    to GL. I think the assumption was that this is just a weird GL quirk
    so we don't expose it. However the value is used as an exponent to
    raise the attenuation to a power so there is no conceptual limit to
    the value.
    
    This removes the mapping and changes some of the documentation.

    cogl-material: Always reset the GLSL program to zero when flushing
    
    When flushing a fixed-function or arbfp material it would always call
    disable_glsl to try to get rid of the previous GLSL shader. This is
    needed even if current_use_program_type is not GLSL because if an
    application calls cogl_program_uniform then Cogl will have to bind the
    program to set the uniform. If this happens then it won't update
    current_use_program_type presumably because the enabled state of arbfp
    is still valid.
    
    The problem was that disable_glsl would only select program zero when
    the current_use_program_type is set to GLSL which wouldn't be the case
    if cogl_program_uniform was called. This patch changes it to just
    directly call _cogl_gl_use_program_wrapper(0) instead of having a
    separate disable_glsl function. The current program is cached in the
    cogl context anyway so it shouldn't cause any extra unnecessary GL
    calls.

    stage: Ignore redraws on destroyed stages
    
    We might get requests to redraw even during destruction; we should
    ignore them and do some NULL checks instead of blindly invoking
    functions.

    cookbook: Fix key press to examine modifers correctly
    
    The simple key press example in the cookbook used a brittle
    and incorrect switch statement to test modifier values. Instead,
    use logical "&" of the state with the modifiers we're interested
    in to check which keys were pressed.

    cogl-material-arbfp: Use separate buffers when calling g_ascii_dtostr
    
    g_ascii_dtostr was being used in four separate arguments to
    g_string_append_printf but all invocations of it were using the same
    buffer. This would end up with all of the arguments having the same
    value which would depend on whichever order the compiler evaluates
    them in. This patches changes it to use a multi-dimensional array and
    a loop to fill in the separate buffers.

    Add an internal _cogl_bitmap_new_from_buffer
    
    This function creates a CoglBitmap which internally references a
    CoglBuffer. The map and unmap functions will divert to mapping the
    buffer. There are also now bind and unbind functions which should be
    used instead of map and unmap whenever the data doesn't need to be
    read from the CPU but will instead be passed to GL for packing or
    unpacking. For bitmaps created from buffers this just binds the
    bitmap.
    
    cogl_texture_new_from_buffer now just uses this function to wrap the
    buffer in a bitmap rather than trying to bind the buffer
    immediately. This means that the buffer will be bound only at the
    point right before the texture data is uploaded.
    
    This approach means that using a pixel array will take the fastest
    upload route if possible, but can still fallback to copying the data
    by mapping the buffer if some conversion is needed. Previously it
    would just crash in this case because the texture functions were all
    passed a NULL pointer.

    Try to avoid copying the GdkPixbuf when it is tightly packed
    
    The docs for GdkPixbuf say that the last row of the image won't
    necessarily be allocated to the size of the full rowstride. The rest
    of Cogl and possibly GL assumes that we can copy the bitmap with
    memcpy(height*rowstride) so we previously would copy the pixbuf data
    to ensure this. However if the rowstride is the same as bpp*width then
    there is no way for the last row to be under-allocated so in this case
    we can just directly upload from the gdk pixbuf. Now that CoglBitmap
    can be created with a destroy function we can make it keep a reference
    to the pixbuf and unref it during its destroy callback. GdkPixbuf
    seems to always pack the image with no padding between rows even if it
    is RGB so this should end up always avoiding the memcpy.
    
    The fallback code for when we do have to copy the pixbuf is now
    simplified so that it copies all of the rows in a single loop. We only
    copy the useful region of each row so this should be safe. The
    rowstride of the CoglBitmap is now always allocated to bpp*width
    regardless of the rowstride of the pixbuf.

    cogl-bitmap: Encapsulate the CoglBitmap even internally
    
    The CoglBitmap struct is now only defined within cogl-bitmap.c so that
    all of its members can now only be accessed with accessor
    functions. To get to the data pointer for the bitmap image you must
    first call _cogl_bitmap_map and later call _cogl_bitmap_unmap. The map
    function takes the same arguments as cogl_pixel_array_map so that
    eventually we can make a bitmap optionally internally divert to a
    pixel array.
    
    There is a _cogl_bitmap_new_from_data function which constructs a new
    bitmap object and takes ownership of the data pointer. The function
    gets passed a destroy callback which gets called when the bitmap is
    freed. This is similar to how gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data
    works. Alternatively NULL can be passed for the destroy function which
    means that the caller will manage the life of the pointer (but must
    guarantee that it stays alive at least until the bitmap is
    freed). This mechanism is used instead of the old approach of creating
    a CoglBitmap struct on the stack and manually filling in the
    members. It could also later be used to create a CoglBitmap that owns
    a GdkPixbuf ref so that we don't necessarily have to copy the
    GdkPixbuf data when converting to a bitmap.
    
    There is also _cogl_bitmap_new_shared. This creates a bitmap using a
    reference to another CoglBitmap for the data. This is a bit of a hack
    but it is needed by the atlas texture backend which wants to divert
    the set_region virtual to another texture but it needs to override the
    format of the bitmap to ignore the premult flag.

    cogl-texture-2d-sliced: Store the internal format not image format
    
    The 'format' member of CoglTexture2DSliced is returned by
    cogl_texture_get_format. All of the other backends return the internal
    format of the GL texture in this case. However the sliced backend was
    returning the format of the image data used to create the texture. It
    doesn't make any sense to retain this information because it doesn't
    necessarily indicate the format of the actual texture. This patch
    changes it to store the internal format instead.

    material: split the texture unit management out
    
    In general cogl-material.c has become far to large to manage in one
    source file. As one of the ways to try and break it down this patch
    starts to move some of lower level texture unit state management out
    into cogl-material-opengl.c. The naming is such because the plan is to
    follow up and migrate the very GL specific state flushing code into the
    same file.

    Add a GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP fallback to the texture 2d and 3d backends
    
    The CoglTexture2DSliced backend has a fallback for when the
    framebuffer extension is missing so it's not possible to use
    glGenerateMipmap. This involves keeping a copy of the upper-left pixel
    of the tex image so that we can temporarily enable GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP
    on the texture object and do a sub texture update by reuploading the
    contents of the first pixel. This patch copies that mechanism to the
    2D and 3D backends. The CoglTexturePixel structure which was
    previously internal to the sliced backend has been moved to
    cogl-texture-private.h so that it can be shared.

    stage: Add the NO_CLEAR_ON_PAINT hint
    
    Some apps or some use cases don't need to clear the stage on immediate
    rendering GPUs. A media player playing a fullscreen video or a
    tile-based game, for instance.
    
    These apps are redrawing the whole screen, so we can avoid clearing the
    color buffer when preparing to paint the stage, since there is no
    blending with the stage color being performed.
    
    We can add an private set of hints to ClutterStage, and expose accessors
    for each potential hint; the first hint is the 'no-clear' one.

    Rename the third texure coordinate from 'r' to 'p'
    
    Using 'r' to name the third component is problematic because that is
    commonly used to represent the red component of a vector representing
    a color. Under GLSL this is awkward because the texture swizzling for
    a vector uses a single letter for each component and the names for
    colors, textures and positions are synonymous. GLSL works around this
    by naming the components of the texture s, t, p and q. Cogl already
    effectively already exposes this naming because it exposes GLSL so it
    makes sense to use that naming consistently. Another alternative could
    be u, v and w. This is what Blender and Direct3D use. However the w
    component conflicts with the w component of a position vertex.

commit dfea57b45ab4636b3484c0c1eed615da0f97f112
Author: Neil Roberts <neil@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 1 22:04:59 2010 +0100

    Add a Cogl texture 3D backend
    
    This adds a publicly exposed experimental API for a 3D texture
    backend. There is a feature flag which can be checked for whether 3D
    textures are supported. Although we require OpenGL 1.2 which has 3D
    textures in core, GLES only provides them through an extension so the
    feature can be used to detect that.
    
    The textures can be created with one of two new API functions :-
    
    cogl_texture_3d_new_with_size
    
     and
    
    cogl_texture_3d_new_from_data
    
    There is also internally a new_from_bitmap function. new_from_data is
    implemented in terms of this function.
    
    The two constructors are effectively the only way to upload data to a
    3D texture. It does not work to call glTexImage2D with the
    GL_TEXTURE_3D target so the virtual for cogl_texture_set_region does
    nothing. It would be possible to make cogl_texture_get_data do
    something sensible like returning all of the images as a single long
    image but this is not currently implemented and instead the virtual
    just always fails. We may want to add API specific to the 3D texture
    backend to get and set a sub region of the texture.
    
    All of those three functions can throw a GError. This will happen if
    the GPU does not support 3D textures or it does not support NPOTs and
    an NPOT size is requested. It will also fail if the FBO extension is
    not supported and the COGL_TEXTURE_NO_AUTO_MIPMAP flag is not
    given. This could be avoided by copying the code for the
    GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP TexParameter fallback, but in the interests of
    keeping the code simple this is not yet done.
    
    This adds a couple of functions to cogl-texture-driver for uploading
    3D data and querying the 3D proxy
    texture. prep_gl_for_pixels_upload_full now also takes sets the
    GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT parameter so that 3D textures can have padding
    between the images. Whenever 3D texture is uploading, both the height
    of the images and the height of all of the data is specified (either
    explicitly or implicilty from the CoglBitmap) so that the image height
    can be deduced by dividing by the depth.

    configure: Include gl2ext.h or glext.h under GLES
    
    Under big GL, glext.h is included automatically by gl.h. However under
    GLES this doesn't appear to happen so it has to be included explicitly
    to get the defines for extensions. This patch changes the
    clutter_gl_header to be called cogl_gl_headers and it can now take a
    space seperated list of multiple headers. This is then later converted
    to a list of #include lines which ends up cogl-defines.h. The gles2
    and gles1 backends now add their respective ext header to this list.

    Make a public CoglBitmapError enum
    
    There are many places in the texture backend that need to do
    conversion using the CoglBitmap code. Currently none of these
    functions can throw an error but they do return a value to indicate
    failure. In future it would make sense if new texture functions could
    throw an error and in that case they would want to use a CoglBitmap
    error if the failure was due to the conversion. This moves the
    internal CoglBitmap error from the quartz backend to be public in
    cogl-bitmap.h so that it can be used in this way.

    Rename COGL_ERROR_MISSING_FEATURE to COGL_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED
    
    We can use this error in more unsupported situations than just when we
    have a Cogl feature flag for the error. For example if a non-sliced
    texture is created with dimensions that are too large then we could
    throw this error. Therefore it seems good to rename to something more
    general.

    cogl-gles2-wrapper: Layers aren't equal if one is enabled and one is not
    
    Previously when comparing whether the settings for a layer are equal
    it would only check if one of them was enabled. If so then it would
    assume the other one was enabled and continue to compare the texture
    environment. Now it also checks whether the enabledness differs.

    x11: Store the group inside the event platform data
    
    Now that we have private, per-event platform data, we can start putting
    it to good use. The first, most simple use is to store the key group
    given the event's modifiers. Since we assume a modern X11, we use XKB
    to retrieve it, or we simply fall back to 0 by default.
    
    The data is exposed as a ClutterX11-specific function, within the
    sanctioned clutter_x11_* namespace.

    events: Add platform-data to allocated Events
    
    Events allocated by Clutter should have a pointer to platform-specific
    data; this would allow backends to add separate structures for holding
    ancillary data, whilst retaining the ClutterEvent structure for use on
    the stack.
    
    In theory, for Clutter 2.x we might just want to drop Event and use an
    opaque structure, or a typed data structure inheriting from
    GTypeInstance instead.

    cogl: Don't define the deprecated ref/unref accessors for new types
    
    Previously COGL_OBJECT_DEFINE would always define deprecated
    cogl_$type_{ref,unref} functions even if the type is new or if the
    type is entirely internal. An application would still find it
    difficult to use these because they wouldn't be in the headers, but it
    still looks bad that they are exported from the shared library. This
    patch changes it so that the deprecated ref counting functions are
    defined using a separate macro and only the types that have these
    functions in the headers call this macro.

    A PangoLayout for an editable, single-line text entry is by definition
    without a given width, since the actor will be clipped when being drawn.

    material: use common node type for materials and layers
    
    Since 365605cf42, materials and layers are represented in a tree
    structure that allows traversing up through parents and iterating down
    through children.  This re-works the related typedefs and reparenting
    code so that they can be shared.

    script: Let ClutterActor parse behaviours
    
    Up until now, the "behaviours" member of an actor definition was parsed
    by the ClutterScript parser itself - even though it's not strictly
    necessary.
    
    In an effort to minimize the ad hoc code in the Script parser, we should
    let ClutterActor handle all the special cases that involve
    actor-specific members.

    Use GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE on GLES when checking supported tex size
    
    Under big GL, _cogl_texture_driver_size_supported uses the proxy
    texture to check whether the given texture size is supported. Proxy
    textures aren't available under GLES so previously this would just
    return TRUE to assume all texture sizes are supported. This patch
    makes it use glGetIntegerv with GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE to give a second
    best guess.
    
    This fixes the sliced texture backend so that it will use slices when
    the texture is too big.

    When an intermediate buffer is used for downloading texture data it
    was using the wrong byte length for a row so the copy back to the

    Use GL_NEAREST filter in the draw-and-read get_data texture fallback
    
    The fallback for when glGetTexImage is not available renders the
    texture to the framebuffer to read the data using glReadPixels. This
    patch just sets the COGL_MATERIAL_FILTER_NEAREST filter mode on the
    material before rendering to avoid linear filtering which would alter
    the texture data.

    Use cogl_read_pixels in the cogl texture draw-and-read fallback
    
    The fallback for when glGetTexImage is not available draws parts of
    the texture to the framebuffer and uses glReadPixels to extract the
    data. However it was using cogl_rectangle to draw and then immediately
    using raw glReadPixels to fetch the data. This won't cause a journal
    flush so the rectangle won't necessarily have hit the framebuffer
    yet. Instead it now uses cogl_read_pixels which does flush the
    journal.

    cogl-material: Fix some problems with flushing texture overrides
    
    There were a few problems flushing texture overrides so that sliced
    textures would not work:
    
    * In _cogl_material_set_layer_texture it ignored the 'overriden'
      parameter and always set texture_overridden to FALSE.
    
    * cogl_texture_get_gl_texture wasn't being called correctly in
      override_layer_texture_cb. It returns a gboolean to indicate the
      error status but this boolean was being assigned to gl_target.
    
    * _cogl_material_layer_texture_equal did not take into account the
      override.
    
    * _cogl_material_layer_get_texture_info did not return the overridden
      texture so it would always use the first texture slice.

    cogl-texture: Share the common code in the set_region virtual
    
    There was a lot of common code that was copied to all of the backends
    to convert the data to a suitable format and wrap it into a CoglBitmap

    This patch moves the common code to cogl-texture.c so that the virtual
    just takes a CoglBitmap that is already in the right format.

    Add a conformance test for cogl_texture_{get_data,set_region}
    
    This verifies that calling cogl_texture_get_data returns the same data
    uploaded to the texture. The bottom quarter of the texture is replaced
    using cogl_texture_set_region. It tries creating the texture with
    different sizes and flags in the hope that it will hit different
    texture backends.

    cogl-texture: Share the common code in the get_data virtual
    
    Previously cogl_texture_get_data would pretty much directly pass on to
    the get_data texture virtual function. This ended up with a lot of
    common code that was copied to all of the backends. For example, the
    method is expected to return the required data size if the data
    pointer is NULL and to calculate its own rowstride if the rowstride is
    0. Also it needs to convert the downloaded data if GL can't support
    that format directly.
    
    This patch moves the common code to cogl-texture.c so the virtual is
    always called with a format that can be downloaded directly by GL and
    with a valid rowstride. If the download fails then the virtual can
    return FALSE in which case cogl-texture will use the draw and read
    fallback.

    tests: don't delay/skip frames due to glReadPixel concerns
    
    This greatly speeds up running all the conformance tests by no longer
    delaying many of the tests for a number of dummy frames to be painted.
    
    We used to skip frames because we thought there was a problem with the
    driver's glReadPixels implementation. Although we have seen driver
    issues at times the real reason the delay was needed was because
    resizing the stage usually happens asynchronously (because a non
    synchronous X request is used by clutter_stage_set_size()). We now force
    all X requests to be synchronized for the conformance tests so this is
    no longer a problem and we can avoid these hacks.

    cogl-vertex-buffer: Default to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for point sprites
    
    For point sprites you are usually drawing the whole texture so you
    most often want GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. This patch removes the override for
    COGL_MATERIAL_WRAP_MODE_AUTOMATIC when point sprites are enabled for a
    layer so that it will clamp to edge.

    cogl-material: Add support for point sprites
    
    This adds a new API call to enable point sprite coordinate generation
    for a material layer:
    
    void
    cogl_material_set_layer_point_sprite_coords_enabled (CoglHandle material,
                                                         int layer_index,
                                                         gboolean enable);
    
    There is also a corresponding get function.
    
    Enabling point sprite coords simply sets the GL_COORD_REPLACE of the
    GL_POINT_SPRITE glTexEnv when flusing the material. There is no
    separate application control for glEnable(GL_POINT_SPRITE). Instead it
    is left permanently enabled under the assumption that it has no affect
    unless GL_COORD_REPLACE is enabled for a texture unit.

    material: set ->layer_index on new layers for unit0
    
    We were mistakenly only initializing layer->layer_index for new layers
    associated with texture units > 0. This had gone unnoticed because
    normally layers associated with texture unit0 have a layer index of 0
    too. Mutter was hitting this issue because it was initializing layer 1
    before layer 0 for one of its materials so layer 1 was temporarily
    associated with texture unit 0.

    test-timeline: instantiate a stage so the master clock runs
    
    This makes test-timeline get the default stage so there is at least one
    stage instantiated. Without any stages the master clock will never run
    which was causing this test to fail.

    Restore the report on the conformance test suite
    
    The report generation was broken by the split of the various test units;
    also, we were using GTest in a way that's not really sanctioned by
    upstream.
    
    This commit tries to re-use the targets from GLib's Makefile rules while
    compensating for our own set up.

    cally: Refactoring "window:create" and "window:destroy" emission code
    
    Previously "window:create" and "window:destroy" were emitted on
    CallyUtil. Although it works, and CallyUtil already have callbacks to
    stage_added/removed signals, I think that it is more tidy/clear to do
    that on CallyRoot:
    
      * CallyRoot already has code to manage ClutterStage addition/removal
    
      * In fact, we can see CallyRoot as the object exposing the a11y
        information from ClutterStageManager, so it fits better here.
    
      * CallyUtil callbacks these signals are related to key event
        listeners (key snooper simulation). One of the main CallyUtil
        responsabilities is managing event (connecting, emitting), so I
        would prefer to not start to add/mix more functionalities here.
    
    Ideally it would be better to emit all CallyStage methods from
    CallyStage, but it is clear that "create" and "destroy" are more easy
    to emit from a external object

    material: route fogging state through CoglMaterial
    
    Previously cogl_set_fog would cause a flush of the Cogl journal and
    would directly bang the GL state machine to setup fogging. As part of
    the ongoing effort to track most state in CoglMaterial to support
    renderlists this now adds an indirection so that cogl_set_fog now just
    updates ctx->legacy_fog_state. The fogging state then gets enabled as a
    legacy override similar to how the old depth testing API is handled.

    osx: explicitly request depth and stencil buffer bits
    
    This is a blind patch because I don't know enough about the osx backend
    and the osx backend probably doesn't even work these days anyway but
    since people have filed bugs specifically on OSX that imply they don't
    have a depth or stencil buffer this tries to fix that.
    
    Maybe someone will eventually pick up the osx backend again and verify
    if this helps.

    cogl-buffer: Track the last used bind target in CoglBuffer
    
    This makes CoglBuffer track the last used bind target as a private
    property. This is later used when binding a buffer to map instead of
    always using the PIXEL_UNPACK target.
    
    This also adds some additional sanity checks that code doesn't try to
    nest binds to the same target or bind a buffer to multiple targets at
    the same time.

    tests: Force X synchronization so the stage size is reliable
    
    Normally the asynchronous nature of X means that setting the clutter
    stage size may really happen an indefinite amount of time later but
    since the tests are so short lived and may only render a single frame
    this is not an acceptable semantic.
    
    This way we should be able to remove all the hacky sleeps and frame
    count delays from our tests.

    tests: no longer clean up state between tests
    
    Since we now run every test in a separate process there is no need to
    try and avoid state leakage between tests. This removes the code to
    cleanup all children of the stage and disconnect handlers from the
    stage paint signal. We now explicitly print a warning if the users tries
    to run multiple tests in one process.

    cogl: expose the semantic differences of gl/gles2 npot textures
    
    This adds three new feature flags COGL_FEATURE_TEXTURE_NPOT_BASIC,
    COGL_FEATURE_TEXTURE_NPOT_MIPMAP and COGL_FEATURE_TEXTURE_NPOT_REPEAT
    that can tell you if your hardware supports non power of two textures,
    npot textures + mipmaps and npot textures + wrap modes other than
    CLAMP_TO_EDGE.
    
    The pre-existing COGL_FEATURE_TEXTURE_NPOT feature implies all of the
    above.
    
    By default GLES 2 core supports npot textures but mipmaps and repeat
    modes can only be used with power of two textures. This patch also makes
    GLES check for the GL_OES_texture_npot extension to determine if mipmaps
    and repeating are supported with npot textures.

    pango-render: set CLAMP_TO_EDGE wrap mode on glyph_material
    
    The pango renderer was causing lots of override materials to be allocated
    because the vertex_buffer API converts AUTOMATIC mode into REPEAT for
    backwards compatibility. By explicitly setting the wrap mode to
    CLAMP_TO_EDGE when creating the glyph_material then the vertex_buffer
    API will leave it untouched.

    pixel-array: Allow passing of hints to cogl_buffer_map
    
    This allows you to tell Cogl that you are planning to replace all the
    buffer's data once it is mapped with cogl_buffer_map. This means if the
    buffer is currently being accessed by the GPU then the driver doesn't
    have to stall and wait for it to finish before it can access it from the
    CPU and can instead potentially allocate a new buffer with undefined
    data and map that.

    cally: Clean up the headers
    
    Make Cally follow the single-include header file policy of Clutter and
    Cogl; this means making cally.h the single include header, and requires
    a new cally-main.h file for the functions defined by cally.h.
    
    Also:
    
      • clean up the licensing notice and remove the FSF address;
    
      • document the object structures (instance and class);
    
      • G_GNUC_CONST-ify the get_type() functions;
    
      • reduce the padding for CallyActor sub-classes;
    
      • reduce the amount of headers included.

    pixel-array: Only allow allocation of arrays with a 2D size
    
    This removes cogl_pixel_array_new which just took a size in bytes.
    
    Without the image size and pixel format then the driver often doesn't
    have enough information to allocate optimal GPU memory that can be
    textured from directly. This is because GPUs often have ways to
    spatially alter the layout of a texture to improve cache access patterns
    which may require special alignment and padding dependant in the images
    width, height and bpp.
    
    Although currently we are limited by OpenGL because it doesn't let us
    pass on the width and height when allocating a PBO, the hope is that we
    can define a better extension at some point.

    cogl-buffer: make the COGL_BUFFER_USAGE_HINT private
    
    The usage hint should be implied by the CoglBuffer subclass type so the
    public getter and setter APIs for manually changing the usage hint of a
    CoglBuffer have now been removed.

    cogl-buffer: Handle subclass registration like cogl-texture
    
    Instead of having to extend cogl_is_buffer with new buffer types
    manually this now adds a new COGL_BUFFER_DEFINE macro to be used instead
    of COGL_OBJECT_DEFINE for CoglBuffer subclasses. This macro will
    automatically register the new type with ctx->buffer_types which will
    iterated by cogl_is_buffer. This is the same coding pattern used for
    CoglTexture.

    material: don't keep extra ref on copy-on-write materials
    
    In _cogl_material_pre_change_notify if a material with descendants is
    modified then we create a new material that is a copy of the one being
    modified and reparent those descendants to the new material.
    
    This patch ensures we drop the reference we get from cogl_material_copy
    since we can rely on the descendants to keep the new material alive.

    The commit to split the fragment processing backends out from
    cogl-material.c (3e1323a6362906a95) broke the GLES 1 and 2 builds the
    fix was to guard the code in each backend according to the
    COGL_MATERIAL_BACKEND_XYZ defines which are setup in
    cogl-material-private.h.

    Fix building the tesselator code for GLES
    
    The tesselator code uses some defines that it expects to be in the GL
    headers such as GLAPI and GLAPIENTRY. These are used to mark the entry
    points as exportable on each platform. We don't really want the
    tesselator code to use these but we also don't want to modify the C
    files so instead they are #defined to be empty in the stub glu.h. That
    header is only included internally when building the tesselator/ files
    so it shouldn't affect the rest of Cogl.
    
    GLES also doesn't have a GLdouble type so we just #define this to be a
    regular double.

    cogl-material: Don't doubly ref the parent in cogl_material_copy
    
    cogl_material_copy was taking a reference on the original texture when
    making a copy. However it then calls _cogl_material_set_parent on the
    material which also takes a reference on the parent. The second
    reference is cleaned up whenever _cogl_material_unparent is called and
    this is also called by _cogl_material_free. However, it seems that
    nothing was cleaning up the first reference. I think the reference is
    entirely unnecessary so this patch removes it.

    align-constraint: Follow the position of the source
    
    The AlignConstraint update is using only the width/height of the source,
    but it should also take into account the position.
    
    Also, instead of using the ::notify signal, it should follow the
    BindConstraint, and switch to the ::allocation-changed signal, since
    it's less expensive (one emission instead of four notifications, one for
    each property we use).

    cogl: declare experimental symbols consistently
    
    We had several different ways of exposing experimental API, in one case
    the symbols had no special suffix, in two other ways the symbols were
    given an _EXP suffix but in different ways.
    
    This makes all experimental API have an _EXP suffix which is handled
    using #defines in the header so the prototypes in the .c and .h files
    don't have the suffix.
    
    The documented reason for the suffix is so that anyone watching Cogl for
    ABI changes who sees symbols disappear will hopefully understand what's
    going on.

    cogl/tesselator: Update to the latest code from GLU
    
    This grabs the latest code for libtess from git Mesa. This is mostly
    so that we can get the following commit which fixes a lot of compiler
    warnings in Clutter:

        glu: Fix some compiler warnings in libtess
    
        When compiled with the more aggressive compiler warnings such as
        -Wshadow and -Wempty-body the libtess code gives a lot more
        warnings. This fixes the following issues:
    
        * The 'Swap' macro tries to combine multiple statements into one and
          then consume the trailing semicolon by using if(1){/*...*/}else.
          This gives warnings because the else part ends up with an empty
          statement. It also seems a bit dangerous because if the semicolon
          were missed then it would still be valid syntax but it would just
          ignore the following statement. This patch replaces it with the more
          common idiom do { /*...*/ } while(0).
    
        * 'free' was being used as a local variable name but this shadows the
          global function. This has been renamed to 'free_handle'
    
        * TRUE and FALSE were being unconditionally defined. Although this
          isn't currently a problem it seems better to guard them with #ifndef
          because it's quite common for them to be defined in other headers.

    docs: Avoid warnings from the g-ir-scanner
    
    The scanner has some issues when parsing valid gtk-doc annotations; we
    should make its (and, in return, ours) life easier.
    
    We still get warnings for code declared in <programlisting> sections,
    unfortunately.

    material: Replace CoglHandle with CoglMaterial *
    
    As part of the ongoing effort to remove CoglHandle from the API this
    switches the cogl_material API to use a strongly typed CoglMaterial
    pointer instead of CoglHandle.

    material: remove a duplicate gtk-doc "Since: 1.4"
    
    The cogl_material_get_depth_writing_enabled documentation had two
    "Since: 1.4" annotations which was confusing the gobject introspection

    backend: fix double free of priv->font_name
    
    If the backend was disposed then priv->font_name would be freed but not
    set to NULL and so if clutter_backend_get_font_name was then called it
    would double free priv->font_name.

    This creates a path with an outer clockwise and two internal sub
    paths, one clockwise and one counter-clockwise. The path is then

    cogl-path: Allow changing the fill rule
    
    This adds two new API calls- cogl_path_set_fill_rule and
    cogl_path_get_fill_rule. This allows modifying the fill rule of the
    current path. In addition to the previous default fill rule of
    'even-odd' it now supports the 'non-zero' rule. The fill rule is a
    property of the path (not the Cogl context) so creating a new path or
    preserving a path with cogl_path_get_handle affects the fill rule.

    cogl-debug: Remove the force-scanline-paths option
    
    The scanline path rasterizer has been removed because the paths can be
    drawn with the tesselator instead. The option therefore no longer does
    anything.

    cogl-path: Use the GLU tesselator to draw paths
    
    Instead of drawing paths using the stencil buffer trick, it now
    tesselates the path into triangles using the GLU tesselator and
    renders them directly. A vbo is created with one vertex for each node
    on the path. The tesselator is used to generate a series of indices
    into the vbo as triangles. The tesselator's output of strips and fans
    is converted into GL_TRIANGLES so that it can be rendered with a
    single draw call (but the vertices are still shared via the
    indices). The vbo is stored with the path so that if the application
    uses retained paths then Cogl won't have to tessellate again.
    
    The vertices also have texture coordinates associated with them so
    that it can replicate the old behaviour of drawing a material with a
    texture by fitting the texture to the bounding box of the path and
    then clipping it. However if the texture contains waste or is sliced
    then the vertex buffer code will refuse to draw it. In this case it
    will revert back to drawing the path into the stencil buffer and then
    drawing the material as a clipped quad.
    
    The VBO is used even when setting up the stencil buffer for clipping
    to a path because the tessellated geometry may cover less area.
    
    The old scanline rasterizer has been removed because the tesselator
    should work equally well on drivers with no stencil buffer.

    cogl: Pull in the code for GLU tesselator from Mesa/SGI
    
    This copies the files for the GLU tesselator from Mesa. The Mesa code
    is based on the original SGI code and is released under a BSD license.
    
    The memalloc.h header has been replaced with one that forces the code
    to use g_malloc and friends. The rest of the files are not altered
    from the original so it should be possible to later upgrade the files
    by simply overwriting them.
    
    There is a tesselator.h header which is expected to be included by
    rest of Cogl to use the tesselator. This contains a trimmed down
    version of glu.h that only includes parts that pertain to the
    tesselator. There is also a stub glu.h in the GL directory which is
    just provided so that the tesselator code can include <GL/gl.h>
    without depending on the system header. It just redirects to
    tesselator.h

    Attached patch contains a cookbook recipe about key press event
    handling.
    
    It covers both a simple approach (connecting a callback to a
    key-press-event signal which manually analyses the key and
    modifiers), and a more complicated one based on a binding pool.
    
    There's also some discussion of the two approaches.

    event: Typos in event code could cause crashes
    
    A typo in clutter-event.c meant that the wrong struct location could be
    used for the input device of key events. Also, a typo in the X11 event
    code meant that key-presses would come from the pointer device (releases
    would still come from the keyboard device).

    text: Document and annotate :font-name for NULL values
    
    Update the documentation of :font-name, to make it clear that by setting
    it to NULL the Text actor will use the default font.
    
    Also, set the annotation for the @font_name argument of the setter to be
    allow-none, and allow passing NULL through bindings.

    text: Update actors using the default font
    
    If a ClutterText actor is using the default font from the backend then
    we should track font name changes and update it accordingly. This only
    applies to ClutterText actors with the :font-name property unset or
    explicitly set to NULL.

    clutter-event-win32: Emit multiple events for WM_MOUSEWHEEL Messages
    
    It's possible that a single WM_MOUSEWHEEL event can arrive with a
    scroll amount greater than WHEEL_DELTA. Previously it would accumulate
    these amounts but it would still only emit a single event per
    message. For example, if a message arrived that is worth two
    WHEEL_DELTAs then it would emit one event and leave scroll_pos as
    +WHEEL_DELTA. If the wheel is then scrolled in the opposite direction
    then wheel delta would end up as zero and the scroll event would get
    lost.
    
    This patch fixes it so that it always emits enough events to put
    scroll_pos back to less than WHEEL_DELTA.

    clutter-event-win32: Directly enqueue events in message_translate
    
    Previously the window procedure for the stage window would always
    create a ClutterEvent struct for every message and then pass that on
    to message_translate to fill in the details. message_translate could
    return FALSE to abandon the event. Instead of this, message_translate
    now creates and queues the event itself whenever it sees a message
    that could translate to an event. The function now returns void. This
    has a number of advantages:
    
    * It saves redundantly allocating events for messages that Clutter
      doesn't care about.
    
    * A single message can now easily be translated into multiple events.
    
    * There were some messages that were handled and did not fill in the
      event struct but did not cause the function to return FALSE. I think
      this would end up with a CLUTTER_NOTHING event being emitted.

    a portable libtool option which should do the right thing on each

    A pedantic change to get_fbconfig_for_depth() so that we don't need to

    get_fbconfig_for_depth() now simply returns FALSE if it fails to find a

    drag-action: Disable picking during drag
    
    While dragging we don't need to perform picking to determine the actor
    underneath the pointer, for two reasons:
    
      • we use a capture on the stage to determine the motion delta.
      • we know the actor underneath the pointer because that's the
        actor we are dragging around.
    
    This change should make dragging actors in complex scenes a bit faster.

    clutter-{glx,x11}-texture-pixmap: Use CoglTexturePixmapX11
    
    The pixmap handling of both of the texture pixmap actors in Clutter is
    now removed and instead it just creates a CoglTexturePixmapX11. Both
    actors are now equivalent so there is no need to choose between the
    two.

commit a197baa53325a99c3a355486bf43a2ccbc1a6220
Author: Neil Roberts <neil@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Tue May 25 18:56:14 2010 +0100

    Add a CoglTexturePixmapX11 texture backend
    
    This is a publicly exposed texture backend to create a texture which
    contains the contents of an X11 pixmap. The API is currently marked as
    experimental.
    
    The backend internally holds a handle to another texture. All of the
    backend virtuals simply redirect to the internal texture.
    
    The texture can optionally be automatically updated if the
    automatic_updates parameter is TRUE. If set then Cogl will listen for
    damage events on the pixmap and update the texture accordingly.
    Alternatively a damage object can be created externally and passed
    down to Cogl.
    
    The updates can be performed with XGetImage, XShmGetImage or the
    GLX_EXT_texture_pixmap extension. If the TFP extension is used it will
    optionally try to create a rectangle texture if the driver does not
    support NPOTs or it is forced through the
    COGL_PIXMAP_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE or CLUTTER_PIXMAP_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE
    environment variables.
    
    If the GLXFBConfig does not support mipmapping then it will fallback
    to using X{Shm,}GetImage. It keeps a separate texture around for this
    so that it can later start using the TFP texture again if the texture

    test-pixmap: Use the 'm' key to toggle texture quality
    
    When the 'm' key is pressed it will now recursively look for all
    ClutterTexture subclasses on the stage and toggle the texture quality
    between high and low. This is useful to test the mipmap fallback.

    test-pixmap: Draw something more interesting when the mouse is clicked
    
    When the mouse button is pressed it would previously draw a small
    1-pixel wide fully transparent line to the pixmap. This is a useful
    feature to help test the automatic updates but the line is quite hard
    to see so it's to easy miss. This patch changes it to draw a thick
    black circle. The circle is drawn at a different position every time
    the button is clicked.

    test-pixmap: Enable automatic updates for the hand
    
    The hand actor has a feature that if you click on the stage it will
    draw a line to the actor. However it's not possible to see the results
    of this because automatic updates were disabled so the texture would
    never be updated.

    This will be defined in cogl-defines.h whenever Cogl is built using a
    winsys that supports X11. This implies CoglTexturePixmapX11 will be

    To make this work the two separate cogl-defines.h.in files have been
    merged into one. The configure script now makes a @COGL_DEFINES@
    substitution variable which contains the #define lines to put in
    rather than directly having them in the seperate files.

    The _cogl_texture_needs_premult_conversion function was already

    conversion if the destination format has no alpha. This patch adds

    This adds the framework needed to check for winsys specific extensions
    (such as GLX extensions) using a similar mechanism to the
    cogl-feature-functions header. There is a separate
    cogl-winsys-feature-functions header which will contain macros to list
    the extensions and functions. cogl_create_context_winsys now calls
    _cogl_feature_check for each of these functions. _cogl_feature_check
    has had to be changed to accept the driver prefix as the first
    parameter so that it can prepend "GLX" rather than "GL" in this case.

    Pass all Xlib events through Cogl
    
    The Clutter X11 backend now passes all events through
    _cogl_xlib_handle_event. This function can now internally be hooked
    with _cogl_xlib_add_filter. These are added to a list of callbacks
    which are all called in turn by _cogl_xlib_handle_event. This is
    intended to be used internally in Cogl by any parts that need to see
    Xlib events.
    
    Cogl now also has an internally exposed function to set a pointer to
    the Xlib display. This is stored in a global variable. The Clutter X11
    backend sets this.
    
    _cogl_xlib_handle_event and _cogl_xlib_set_display can be removed once
    Cogl gains a proper window system abstraction.

    cogl-texture: Replace the ensure_mipmaps virtual with pre_paint
    
    Instead of the ensure_mipmaps virtual that is only called whenever the
    texture is about to be rendered with a min filter that needs the
    mipmap, there is now a pre_paint virtual that is always called when
    the texture is about to be painted in any way. It has a flags
    parameter which is used to specify whether the mipmap will be needed.
    
    This is useful for CoglTexturePixmapX11 because it needs to do stuff
    before painting that is unrelated to mipmapping.

    Instead of having a hardcoded series of if-statements in
    cogl_is_texture to determine which types should appear as texture
    subclasses, they are now stored in a GSList attached to the Cogl
    context. The list is amended to using a new cogl_texture_register_type
    function. There is a convenience macro called COGL_TEXTURE_DEFINE
    which uses COGL_HANDLE_DEFINE_WITH_CODE to register the texture type
    when the _get_type() function is first called.

    COGL_HANDLE_DEFINE_WITH_CODE.

    x11: Add the XSETTINGS machinery
    
    Use the XSETTINGS machinery to get notification from foreign
    environments about settings that might interest Clutter itself - namely:
    the default font name, the font DPI, and the Xft font options that can
    be mapped on cairo_font_options_t.

    clutter-event-egl had nothing to do with EGL, it's code for opening

    egl: support creating OpenGL contexts
    
    Right before we create the EGL context, we check if we were built with
    OpenGL or OpenGLES support and it was OpenGL then we call eglBindAPI
    (EGL_OPENGL_API); This also explicitly requests a EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE
    supporting the EGL_OPENGL_BIT.
    
    This will let us add a new ./configure flavour that combines OpenGL and
    EGL instead of OpenGL and GLX.

    build: Adds a new opengl-egl-xlib build flavour
    
    With this patch if you ./configure clutter using
    --with-flavour=opengl-egl-xlib then it will use EGL + OpenGL instead of
    the default GLX and OpenGL.
    
    These days upstream driver work is more focused on improving EGL than it
    is GLX so likewise we want to make sure Clutter has good support for
    EGL.

    build: distinguish CLUTTER_WINSYS and CLUTTER_SONAME_INFIX
    
    This adds a separate variable name "CLUTTER_SONAME_INFIX" to define the
    infix for the clutter library that gets linked. Currently the WINSYS
    corresponds to the directory we enter when building to compile the
    window system and input support, but it is desirable to be able to
    define multiple flavours that use the same WINSYS but should result in
    different library names.
    
    For example we are planning to combine the eglx and eglnative window
    systems into one "egl" winsys but we will need to preserve the current
    library names for the eglx and eglnative flavours.

    configure.ac: avoid some duplication
    
    When we check the flavour we now just set boolean variables for the
    following things:
    
    SUPPORT_X11=1
    SUPPORT_XLIB=1
    SUPPORT_GLX=1
    SUPPORT_EGL=1
    SUPPORT_EGL_POWERVR_X11=1
    SUPPORT_EGL_POWERVR_NULL=1
    
    This lets us avoid some duplication and also some error prone tests for
    lists of flavours used, for example, to determine when we need to check
    for x libraries.

    configure.ac: distinguish CLUTTER_FLAVOUR and CLUTTER_WINSYS
    
    It's desirable to have a separation between the "flavour" and the
    "winsys". The flavour is a concept internal to the configure script and
    is a convenient name to represent the users choice of window system,
    opengl driver and input backend. The CLUTTER_WINSYS currently defines
    the subdirectory under clutter/ that should be compiled to handle the
    window system and input.
    
    With a separation we could add a flavour with no correspondence to which
    clutter/subdirectory needs to be built.

    configure.ac: move the special handling of the fruity flavour
    
    After checking the flavour option the user gives we were checking for
    the fruity flavour to override the glesversion. Now that the glsl
    checking has been moved this can instead just wait until the AS_CASE
    that handles all the flavour configuration.

    configure.ac: move gles checks after the flavour checks
    
    The flavour AS_CASE should define whether a flavour uses the gl or gles
    COGL_DRIVER and so we shouldn't need to have an expanding list of
    tests to gate when we check for a gles driver because if we move the
    checks for gles after the flavour checks we can just look at
    $COGL_DRIVER.

    This makes more of the file relocatable because there were previously

    clutter-stage: Use g_array_free instead of g_array_unref
    
    g_array_unref was only added in GLib 2.22 so we should really update
    the requirements in the configure script if we want to use that
    function. However the array doesn't appear to have any extra reference
    taken on it anywhere so it should be safe to use g_array_free instead.

    Under WGL, any functions that were defined after GL 1.1 are not

    cogl-material: Don't use the symbol 'near'
    
    The window headers contain the line
    
     #define near
    
    so it's not possible to use the symbol 'near' in code that's portable
    to Windows. This replaces it with 'near_val'.
    
    I think the define is meant to improve compatibility with code written
    for Windows 3.1 where near would be a keyword to make it a smaller
    pointer size.

    actor: Parse actions, constraints and effects members
    
    ClutterActor should allow attaching actions, constraints and effects
    just like it allows behaviours, e.g.:
    
      {
        ...
        "constraints" : [
          {
            "type" : "ClutterAlignConstraint",
            "source" : "stage",
            "align-axis" : "x-axis",
            "factor" : 0.5
          },
          {
            "type" : "ClutterAlignConstraint",
            "source" : "stage",
            "align-axis" : "y-axis",
            "factor" : 0.5
          }
        ],
        ...
      }
    
    or:
    
      {
        ...
        "actions" : [
          {
            "type" : "ClutterDragAction",
            "signals" : [
              { "name" : "drag-end", "handler" : "on_drag_end" }
            ]
          }
        ],
        ...
      }
    
    In order to do so, we use the Scriptable interface implementation and
    add three new custom properties accepting an array; then we parse each
    member of the array as a new object.

    constraints: Allow Align and Bind sources to be NULL
    
    Since constructing AlignConstraint and BindConstraint instances could be
    deferred (think ClutterScript) we need to make their :source properties
    setters accept NULL. This does not break the constraints because they
    need to handle that condition in case they actor to which they are
    applied is destroyed and somebody is holding a reference on them anyway.

    script-parser: Expose extracting the id from a node
    
    The get_id_from_node() internal function should be exposed inside

    custom parsing code. The code is pretty trivial, but it would be
    pointless to re-implement it.

    cairo-texture: Disable :sync-size
    
    The :sync-size property of ClutterTexture should be set to FALSE by
    default by ClutterCairoTexture. The preferred size of the
    ClutterCairoTexture is already the size of the internal Cairo surface,
    and we override the preferred width/height getters to that effect.
    
    The :sync-size property is also responsible of changing the size of
    the Texture actor when changing the texture handle - but since we
    encourage that to happen during the CairoTexture allocation, we get a
    queue_relayout() invocation (and a warning) when we change the size
    of the Cairo image surface.
    
    Since GObject doesn't make it easy to override the default value of the
    :sync-size property in sub-classes, we should simply call the setter
    function during the ClutterCairoTexture instance initialization.
    
    We should also change one of the interactive tests using a CairoTexture
    to rebuild the contents of the actor in response to an allocation.

    stage-glx: Never promote clipped redraws to full redraws.
    
    When clipped redraws were first supported in Clutter a heuristic was
    added to promote tall clipped redraws into full redraws due to a concern
    that using glXCopySubBuffer for tall rectangles would block the GPU for
    too long waiting for the vtrace to be in a suitable position so that
    tearing isn't seen. We've so far been unable to measure any impact from
    this blocking even with full height windows so we are removing the
    arbitrary threshold of 300px that was originally "plucked out of thin
    air".

    We don't need to generate a new ARBfp program for every material created
    if we can find an ancestor whos state will result in the same program

    The more code we can have adopt the coding pattern of deriving their
    materials from other similar materials using cogl_material_copy() the
    more likely this metric will be good enough on its own to minimize the
    set of arbfp programs necessary to support a given application.

    Adds an internal weak material mechanism
    
    This adds a _cogl_material_weak_copy() function that can be used to
    create materials that don't count as strong dependants on their parents.
    This means the parent can be modified without worrying about how it will
    affect weak materials. The material age of the parent can potentially be
    queried to determine if a weak material might need to be re-created.

    material: Adds a simple material age getter
    
    When we add support for weak materials it's expected that Clutter will
    want to attach them as private data to other materials and it needs a
    mechanism to determine when a weak material should be re-created because
    its parent has changed somehow.
    
    This adds the concept of a material age (internal only currently) which
    increments whenever a material is modified. Clutter can then save the
    age of the material which its weak materials are derived from and later
    determine when the weak material may be invalid.

    material: Make CoglMaterial responsible for depth state
    
    This redirects the legacy depth testing APIs through CoglMaterial and
    adds a new experimental cogl_material_ API for handling the depth
    testing state.
    
    This adds the following new functions:
    cogl_material_set_depth_test_enabled
    cogl_material_get_depth_test_enabled
    cogl_material_set_depth_writing_enabled
    cogl_material_get_depth_writing_enabled
    cogl_material_set_depth_test_function
    cogl_material_get_depth_test_function
    cogl_material_set_depth_range
    cogl_material_get_depth_range
    
    As with other experimental Cogl API you need to define
    COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_API to access them and their stability isn't
    yet guaranteed.

    cogl_ortho is one of those APIs whos style was, for better or worse,
    copied from OpenGL and for some inexplicable reason the near and far
    arguments are inconsistent with the left, right, top, bottom arguments
    because they don't take z coordinates they take a "distance" which
    should be negative for a plane behind the viewer.
    
    This updates the documentation to explain this.

    cogl: remove _cogl_material_flush_gl_state flush options
    
    Since cogl_material_copy should now be cheap to use we can simplify
    how we handle fallbacks and wrap mode overrides etc by simply copying
    the original material and making our override changes on the new
    material. This avoids the need for a sideband state structure that has
    been growing in size and makes flushing material state more complex.
    
    Note the plan is to eventually use weak materials for these override
    materials and attach these as private data to the original materials so
    we aren't making so many one-shot materials.

    CoglMaterial: Implements sparse materials design
    
    This is a complete overhaul of the data structures used to manage
    CoglMaterial state.
    
    We have these requirements that were aiming to meet:
    (Note: the references to "renderlists" correspond to the effort to
    support scenegraph level shuffling of Clutter actor primitives so we can
    minimize GPU state changes)
    
    Sparse State:
    We wanted a design that allows sparse descriptions of state so it scales
    well as we make CoglMaterial responsible for more and more state. It
    needs to scale well in terms of memory usage and the cost of operations
    we need to apply to materials such as comparing, copying and flushing
    their state. I.e. we would rather have these things scale by the number
    of real changes a material represents not by how much overall state
    CoglMaterial becomes responsible for.
    
    Cheap Copies:
    As we add support for renderlists in Clutter we will need to be able to
    get an immutable handle for a given material's current state so that we
    can retain a record of a primitive with its associated material without
    worrying that changes to the original material will invalidate that
    record.
    
    No more flush override options:
    We want to get rid of the flush overrides mechanism we currently use to
    deal with texture fallbacks, wrap mode changes and to handle the use of
    highlevel CoglTextures that need to be resolved into lowlevel textures
    before flushing the material state.
    
    The flush options structure has been expanding in size and the structure
    is logged with every journal entry so it is not an approach that scales
    well at all. It also makes flushing material state that much more
    complex.
    
    Weak Materials:
    Again for renderlists we need a way to create materials derived from
    other materials but without the strict requirement that modifications to
    the original material wont affect the derived ("weak") material. The
    only requirement is that its possible to later check if the original
    material has been changed.
    
    A summary of the new design:
    
    A CoglMaterial now basically represents a diff against its parent.
    Each material has a single parent and a mask of state that it changes.
    
    Each group of state (such as the blending state) has an "authority"
    which is found by walking up from a given material through its ancestors
    checking the difference mask until a match for that group is found.
    
    There is only one root node to the graph of all materials, which is the
    default material first created when Cogl is being initialized.
    
    All the groups of state are divided into two types, such that
    infrequently changed state belongs in a separate "BigState" structure
    that is only allocated and attached to a material when necessary.
    
    CoglMaterialLayers are another sparse structure. Like CoglMaterials they
    represent a diff against their parent and all the layers are part of
    another graph with the "default_layer_0" layer being the root node that
    Cogl creates during initialization.
    
    Copying a material is now basically just a case of slice allocating a
    CoglMaterial, setting the parent to be the source being copied and
    zeroing the mask of changes.
    
    Flush overrides should now be handled by simply relying on the cheapness
    of copying a material and making changes to it. (This will be done in a
    follow on commit)
    
    Weak material support will be added in a follow on commit.

    material: fix #ifdef guard around use of _TEXTURE_RECTANGLE
    
    We were incorrectly guarding the use of GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB with
    ifdef ARB_texture_rectangle instead of ifdef GL_ARB_texture_rectangle
    which broke test-cogl-texture-rectangle.

    blend-strings: removes the AUTO_COMPOSITE function enum
    
    This was mistakenly added some time ago because at some point when we
    were discussing how to handle premultiplied alpha in Clutter/Cogl we
    were considering having a magic "just do the right thing" option which
    was later abandoned.

    cogl-color: add cogl_color_init_from_xyz funcs
    
    This is to try and improve API consistency. Simple cogl structures that
    don't derive from CoglObject and which can be allocated on the stack,
    such as CoglColor and CoglMatrix should all have  "_init" or
    "_init_from" functions to initialize all the structure members. (As
    opposed to a cogl_xyz_new() function for CoglObjects). CoglColor
    previously used the naming scheme "_set_from" for these initializers but
    "_set" is typically reserved for setting individual properties of a
    structure/object.
    
    This adds three _init functions:
    cogl_color_init_from_4ub
    cogl_color_init_from_4f
    cogl_color_init_from_4fv
    
    The _set_from functions are now deprecated but only with a gtk-doc
    annotation for now. This is because the cogl_color_set_from API is quite
    widely used already and so were giving a grace period before enabling a
    GCC deprecated warning just because otherwise the MX maintainers will
    complain to me that I've made their build logs look messy.

    cogl-color: add private _cogl_color_get_rgba_4ubv API
    
    The journal logs colors as 4bytes into a vertex array and since we are
    planning to make CoglMaterial track its color using a CoglColor instead
    of a byte array this convenience will be useful for re-implementing
    _cogl_material_get_colorubv.

    clutter-text: Round the layout width to nearest integer not down
    
    When converting the floating point allocation width to an integer
    multiple of PANGO_SCALE to give to the PangoLayout it can sometimes
    end up slightly short of the allocated size due to rounding
    errors. This can cause some of the lines to be wrapped differently
    when a non-integer-aligned position is used (such as when animating
    text). It works better to round the number to the nearest integer by
    adding 0.5 instead of letting the default float cast truncate it
    downwards.

    Hide the marshallers
    
    The marshallers we use for the signals are declared in a private header,
    and it stands to reason that they should also be hidden in the shared
    object by using the common '_' prefix. We are also using some direct
    g_cclosure_marshal_* symbol from GLib, instead of consistently use the
    clutter_marshal_* symbol.

    shader-effect: Allow creating vertex shaders
    
    By default, ShaderEffect creates a fragment shader; in order to be able
    to deprecate ClutterShader we need a way for ShaderEffect sub-classes to
    create a vertex shader if needed - By using a write-only, constructor
    only property.
    
    ClutterShader has, internally, a ClutterShaderType enumeration that can
    be used exactly for this. We just need to expose it and create a GObject
    property for ClutterShaderEffect.

    cogl-clip-stack: Always use the scissor when clipping
    
    Whenever a path or a rectangle is added to the clip stack it now also
    stores a screen space bounding box in the entry. Then when the clip
    stack is flushed the bounding box is first used to set up the
    scissor. That way when we eventually come to use the stencil buffer
    the clear will be affected by the scissor so we don't have to clear
    the entire buffer.

    _cogl_path_get_bounds is no longer static and is exported in
    cogl-path-private.h so that it can be used in the clip stack code. The
    old version of the function returned x/y and width/height. However
    this was mostly used to call cogl_rectangle which takes x1/y1
    x2/y2. The function has been changed to just directly return the
    second form because it is more useful. Anywhere that was previously
    using the function now just directly looks at path->path_nodes_min and
    path->path_nodes_max instead.

    We only had getters for the red, green, blue and alpha channels of a

    Instead of this, just provide some setters for CoglColor, using the same
    naming scheme than the existing getters.

    cogl-framebuffer: Use the FBO extension for color sizes
    
    OpenGL 3.0 deprecated querying of the GL_{RED,GREEN,BLUE}_BITS
    constants, and the FBO extension provides a mechanism to query for the
    color buffer sizes which *should* work even with the default
    framebuffer. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to hold for Mesa - so we
    just use this for the offscreen CoglFramebuffer type, and we fall back

    effect: Add DeformEffect
    
    DeformEffect is an abstract class that should be used to write effects
    that change the geometry of an actor before submitting it to the GPU.
    
    Just like the ShaderEffect class, DeformEffect renders the actor to
    which it has been applied into an FBO; then it creates a mesh and stores
    it inside a VBO. Sub-classes can control vertex attributes like
    position, texel coordinates and the color.

    cogl-material: Fix the function which sets the enable blend flag
    
    This function had two problems. Firstly it would clear the enable
    blend flag before calling pre_change_notify so that if blending was
    previously enabled the journal would end up being flushed while the
    flag was still cleared. Secondly it would call the pre change notify
    whenever blending is needed regardless of whether it was already
    needed previously.
    
    This was causing problems in test-depth.

    material: Adds backend abstraction for fragment processing
    
    As part of an effort to improve the architecture of CoglMaterial
    internally this overhauls how we flush layer state to OpenGL by adding a
    formal backend abstraction for fragment processing and further
    formalizing the CoglTextureUnit abstraction.
    
    There are three backends: "glsl", "arbfp" and "fixed". The fixed backend
    uses the OpenGL fixed function APIs to setup the fragment processing,
    the arbfp backend uses code generation to handle fragment processing
    using an ARBfp program, and the GLSL backend is currently only there as
    a formality to handle user programs associated with a material. (i.e.
    the glsl backend doesn't yet support code generation)
    
    The GLSL backend has highest precedence, then arbfp and finally the
    fixed. If a backend can't support some particular CoglMaterial feature
    then it will fallback to the next backend.
    
    This adds three new COGL_DEBUG options:
    * "disable-texturing" as expected should disable all texturing
    * "disable-arbfp" always make the arbfp backend fallback
    * "disable-glsl" always make the glsl backend fallback
    * "show-source" show code generated by the arbfp/glsl backends

    cogl-atlas-texture: Flush the journal before starting blit not after
    
    _cogl_atlas_texture_blit_begin binds a texture to use as the
    destination and it expects it to stay bound until
    _cogl_atlas_texture_end_blit is called. However there was a call to
    _cogl_journal_flush directly after setting up the blit state which
    could cause the wrong texture to be bound. This just moves the flush
    to before the call to _cogl_atlas_texture_blit_begin.
    
    This was breaking test-cogl-sub-texture.

    atlas: fix some journal flushing issues
    
    1) Always flush when migrating textures out of an atlas because although
    it's true that the original texture data will remain valid in the
    original texture we can't assume that journal entries have resolved the
    GL texture that will be used. This is only true if a layer0_override has
    been used.
    
    2) Don't flush at the point of creating a new atlas simply flush
    immediately before reorganizing an atlas. This means we are now assuming
    that we will never see recursion due to atlas textures being modified
    during a journal flush. This means it's the responsibility of the
    primitives code to _ensure_mipmaps for example not the responsibility of
    _cogl_material_flush_gl_state.

    primitives: make sure to update texture storage before drawing
    
    We want to make sure that the material state flushing code will never
    result in changes to the texture storage for that material. So for
    example mipmaps need to be ensured by the primitives code.
    
    Changes to the texture storage will invalidate the texture coordinates
    in the journal and we want to avoid a recursion of journal flushing.

    cogl-material: Use fragment programs instead of texture env combiners
    
                          THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
    
    Mesa is building a big shader when using ARB_texture_env_combine. The
    idea is to bypass that computation, do it ourselves and cache the
    compiled program in a CoglMaterial.
    
    For now that feature can be enabled by setting the COGL_PIPELINE
    environment variable to "arbfp". COGL_SHOW_FP_SOURCE can be set to a non
    empty string to dump the fragment program source too.
    
    TODO:
      * fog (really easy, using OPTION)
      * support tex env combiner operands, DOT3, ADD_SIGNED, INTERPOLATE
        combine modes (need refactoring the generation of temporary
        variables) (not too hard)
      * alpha testing for GLES 2.0?

    cogl: Introduce private feature flags and check for ARB_fp
    
    The Cogl context has now a feature_flags_private enum that will allow us
    to query and use OpenGL features without exposing them in the public
    API.
    
    The ARB_fragment_program extension is the first user of those flags.
    Looking for this extension only happens in the gl driver as the gles
    drivers will not expose them.
    
    One can use _cogl_features_available_private() to check for the
    availability of such private features.
    
    While at it, reindent cogl-internal.h as described in CODING_STYLE.

    backend-glx: Avoid vblank waits/glFinish calls when throttling blits
    
    If we have the GLX_SGI_video_sync extension then it's possible to always
    keep track for the video sync counter each time we call glXSwapBuffers
    or do a sub stage blit. This then allows us to avoid waiting before
    issuing a blit if we can see that the counter has already progressed.
    
    Also since we expect that glXCopySubBuffer is synchronized to the vblank
    we don't need to use glFinish () in conjunction with the vblank wait
    since the vblank wait's only purpose is to add a delay.

    backend-glx: Make sure to throttle sub region blits
    
    Neither glXCopySubBuffer or glBlitFramebuffer are integrated with the
    swap interval of a framebuffer so that means when we do partial stage
    updates (as Mutter does in response to window damage) then the blits
    aren't throttled which means applications that throw lots of damage
    events at the compositor can effectively cause Clutter to run flat out
    taking up all the system resources issuing more blits than can even be
    seen.
    
    This patch now makes sure we use the GLX_SGI_video_sync or a
    DRM_VBLANK_RELATIVE ioctl to throttle blits to the vblank frequency as
    we do when using glXSwapBuffers.

    a driver does not support GLX_MESA_copy_sub_buffer we fall back to redrawing
    the complete stage which isn't really optimal.
    
    So instead to directly fallback to complete redraws try using GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit
    to do the BACK to FRONT buffer copies.

    cogl-gles2-wrapper: Fix some cases using the wrong texture unit
    
    At two places in cogl_wrap_prepare_for_draw it was trying to loop over
    the texture units to flush some state. However it was retrieving the
    texture unit pointer using w->active_texture_unit instead of the loop
    index so it would end up with the wrong state.
    
    Also in glEnableClientState it was using the active unit instead of
    the client active unit.

    script: Support layout manager properties
    
    Layout properties work similarly to child properties, with the added
    headache that they require the 3-tuple:
    
      ( layout manager, container, actor )
    
    to be valid in order to be inspected, parsed and applied. This means
    using the newly added back-pointer from the container to the layout
    manager and then rejigging a bit how the ScriptParser handles the
    unresolved properties.
    
    Similarly to the child properties, which use the "child::" prefix, the
    layout manager properties use the "layout::" prefix and are defined with
    the child of a container holding a layout manager.

     • 3 general fixes (typos, copy/paste),
     • ignore cogl-object-private.h,
     • cogl_fixed_atani() was in reality cogl_fixed_atan(), fixed in commit
       43564f05.
     • Fix the cogl-vector section: sections must have a </SECTION> tag at
       the end. Also the cogl-vector section was added in the middle of the
       cogl-buffer one. Let's shiffle it out and add that </SECTION> tag.

    shader-effect: Simplify setting the shader source
    
    Sub-classes of ShaderEffect currently have to get the handle for the
    Cogl shader and call cogl_shader_source(); this makes it awkward to
    implement a ShaderEffect, and it exposes handles and Cogl API that we
    might want to change in the future.
    
    We should provide a ClutterShaderEffect method that allows to (safely)
    set the shader source at the right time for sub-classes to use.

    effect: Rework the OffscreenEffect painting
    
    The OffscreenEffect should set up the off screen draw buffer so that it
    has the same projection and modelview as if it where on screen; we
    achieve that by setting up the viewport to be the same size of the stage
    but with an initial offset given by the left-most vertex of the actor.
    
    When we paint the texture attached to the FBO we then set up the
    modelview matrix of the on screen draw buffer so that it's the same as
    the stage one: this way, the texture will be painted in screen
    coordinates and it will occupy the same area as the actor would have
    had.

    A simple, GLSL shader-based blur effect.
    
    The blur shader is taken straight from the test-shader.c interactive

    effect: Add ShaderEffect
    
    The ShaderEffect class is an abstract base type for shader-based
    effects. GLSL-based effects should be implemented by sub-classing
    ShaderEffect and overriding ActorMeta::set_actor() to set the source
    code of the shader, and Effect::pre_paint() to update the uniform
    values, if any.
    
    The ShaderEffect has a generic API for sub-classes to set the values
    of the uniforms defined by their shaders, and it uses the shader
    types we defined for ClutterShader, to avoid re-inventing the wheel
    every time.

commit c3ab32ae6887a222472f4fc9025437ab91d0bbce
Author: Emmanuele Bassi <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

    effect: Add OffscreenEffect
    
    The OffscreenEffect class is meant to be used to implement Effect
    sub-classes that create an offscreen framebuffer and redirect the
    actor's paint sequence there. The OffscreenEffect is useful for
    effects using fragment shaders.
    
    Any shader-based effect being applied to an actor through an offscreen
    buffer should be used before painting the resulting target material and
    not for every actor. This means that doing:
    
           pre_paint: cogl_program_use(program)
                      set up offscreen buffer
               paint: [ actors ] → offscreen buffer → target material
          post_paint: paint target material
                      cogl_program_use(null)
    
    Is not correct. Unfortunately, we cannot really do:
    
          post_paint: cogl_program_use(program)
                      paint target material
                      cogl_program_use(null)
    
    Because the OffscreenEffect::post_paint() implementation also pops the
    offscreen buffer and re-instates the previous framebuffer:
    
          post_paint: cogl_program_use(program)
                      change frame buffer ← ouch!
                      paint target material
                      cogl_program_use(null)
    
    One way to fix it is to allow using the shader right before painting
    the target material - which means adding a new virtual inside the
    OffscreenEffect class vtable in additions to the ones defined by the
    parent Effect class.
    
    The newly-added paint_target() virtual allows the correct sequence of
    actions by adding an entry point for sub-classes to wrap the "paint
    target material" operation with custom code, in order to implement the
    case above correctly as:
    
          post_paint: change frame buffer
                      cogl_program_use(program)
                      paint target material
                      cogl_program_use(null)
    
    The added upside is that sub-classes of OffscreenEffect involving
    shaders really just need to override the prepare() and paint_target()
    virtuals, since the pre_paint() and post_paint() do all that's needed.

    Add the ClutterEffect abstract class
    
    ClutterEffect is an abstract class that should be used to apply effects
    on generic actors.
    
    The ClutterEffect class just defines what an effect should implement; it
    could be defined as an interface, but we might want to add some default
    behavior dependent on the internal state at a later point.
    
    The effect API applies to any actor, so we need to provide a way to
    assign an effect to an actor, and let ClutterActor call the Effect
    methods during the paint sequence.
    
    Once an effect is attached to an actor we will perform the paint in this
    order:
    
      • Effect::pre_paint()
      • Actor::paint signal emission
      • Effect::post_paint()
    
    Since an effect might collide with the Shader class, we either allow a
    shader or an effect for the time being.

    actor: Reset the modelview matrix
    
    When getting the relative modelview matrix we need to reset it to the
    stage's initial state or, at least, initialize it to the identity
    matrix, instead of assuming we have an empty stack.

    analysis: None used in pointer context
    
    While this is totally fine (None is 0L and, in the pointer context, will
    be converted in the right internal NULL representation, which could be a
    value with some bits to 1), I believe it's clearer to use NULL instead
    of None when we talk about pointers.

    It seems that, in most case, it's more an overlook than a deliberate

    Start eradicating the CoglHandle typedef
    
    CoglHandle is a common source of complaints and confusion because people
    expect a "handle" to be some form of integer type with some indirection
    to lookup the corresponding objects as opposed to a direct pointer.
    
    This patch starts by renaming CoglHandle to CoglObject * and creating
    corresponding cogl_object_ APIs to replace the cogl_handle ones.
    
    The next step though is to remove all use of CoglHandle in the Cogl APIs
    and replace with strongly typed pointer types such as CoglMaterial * or
    CoglTexture * etc also all occurrences of COGL_INVALID_HANDLE can just
    use NULL instead.
    
    After this we will consider switching to GTypeInstance internally so we
    can have inheritance for our types and hopefully improve how we handle
    bindings.
    
    Note all these changes will be done in a way that maintains the API and
    ABI.

    texture: don't use a static bool to gate warning
    
    in create_pick_material we were using a static boolean to gate when we
    show a warning, but that would mean if the problem recurs between
    different textures then the warning will only be shown once. We now have
    a private bitfield flag instead, just so we don't spew millions of
    warnings if the problem is recurring.

    [texture] Support picking textures according to their alpha channel
    
    This adds a boolean "pick-with-alpha" property to ClutterTexture and when
    true, it will use the textures alpha channel to define the actors shape when
    picking.
    
    Users should be aware that it's a bit more expensive to pick textures like
    this (so probably best not to blindly enable it on *all* your textures)
    since it implies rasterizing the texture during picking whereas we would
    otherwise just send a solid filled quad to the GPU.  It will also interrupt
    the internal batching of geometry for pick renders which can otherwise often
    be done in a single draw call.

    [material] fix _set_alpha_test_function: missing a glEnable(GL_ALPHA_TEST)
    
    Since the default alpha test function of GL_ALWAYS is equivalent to
    GL_ALPHA_TEST being disabled we don't need to worry about Enabling/Disabling
    it when flushing material state, instead it's enough to leave it always
    enabled.  We will assume that any driver worth its salt wont incur any
    additional cost for glEnable (GL_ALPHA_TEST) + GL_ALWAYS vs
    glDisable (GL_ALPHA_TEST).
    
    This patch simply calls glEnable (GL_ALPHA_TEST) in cogl_create_context

    cogl: Record new enabled arrays in _cogl_disable_other_texcoord_arrays
    
    When _cogl_disable_other_texcoord_arrays is called it disables the
    neccessary texcoord arrays and then removes the bits for the disabled
    arrays in ctx->texcoord_arrays_enabled. However none of the places
    that call the function then set any bits in ctx->texcoord_arrays_enabled
    so the arrays would never get marked and they would never get disabled
    again.
    
    This patch just changes it so that _cogl_disable_other_texcoord_arrays
    also sets the corresponding bits in ctx->texcoord_arrays_enabled.

    drag-action: Re-use press_button in emit_drag_end()
    
    Since emit_drag_end() can be called from a MOTION event capture we
    cannot call clutter_event_get_button(). We should, instead, use the
    press_button value because if we're emitting ::drag-end it means we
    also emitted ::drag-begin and the value is valid.

    cogl: Use a CoglBitmask to store the list of used texcoord arrays
    
    Instead of directly using a guint32 to store a bitmask for each used
    texcoord array, it now stores them in a CoglBitmask. This removes the
    limitation of 32 layers (although there are still other places in Cogl
    that imply this restriction). To disable texcoord arrays code should
    call _cogl_disable_other_texcoord_arrays which takes a bitmask of
    texcoord arrays that should not be disabled. There are two extra
    bitmasks stored in the CoglContext which are used temporarily for this
    function to avoid allocating a new bitmask each time.

    cogl: Add an internal CoglBitmask type
    
    This implements a growable array of bits called CoglBitmask. The
    CoglBitmask is intended to be cheap if less than 32 bits are used. If
    more bits are required it will allocate a GArray. The type is meant to
    be allocated on the stack but because it can require additional
    resources it also has a destroy function.

    cogl-material: Fix the count of the number of layers
    
    Previously the counter for the number of layers was only updated
    whenever the texture handle for a layer changes. However there are
    many other ways for a new layer to be created for example by setting a
    layer combine constant. Also by default the texture on a layer is
    COGL_INVALID_HANDLE so if the application tries to create an explicit
    layer with no texture by calling cogl_material_set_layer with
    COGL_INVALID_HANDLE then it also wouldn't update the count.
    
    This patch fixes that by incrementing the count in
    cogl_material_get_layer instead. This function is called by all
    functions that may end up creating a layer so it seems like the most
    appropriate place.

    cogl-vertex-buffer: Don't disable layers with no texture coords
    
    It should be quite acceptable to use a texture without defining any
    texture coords. For example a shader may be in use that is doing
    texture lookups without referencing the texture coordinates. Also it
    should be possible to replace the vertex colors using a texture layer
    without a texture but with a constant layer color.
    
    enable_state_for_drawing_buffer no longer sets any disabled layers in
    the overrides. Instead of counting the number of units with texture
    coordinates it now keeps them in a mask. This means there can now be
    gaps in the list of enabled texture coordinate arrays. To cope with
    this, the Cogl context now also stores a mask to track the enabled
    arrays. Instead of code manually iterating each enabled array to
    disable them, there is now an internal function called
    _cogl_disable_texcoord_arrays which disables a given mask.
    
    I think this could also fix potential bugs when a vertex buffer has
    gaps in the texture coordinate attributes that it provides. For
    example if the vertex buffer only had texture coordinates for layer 2
    then the disabling code would not disable the coordinates for layers 0
    and 1 even though they are not used. This could cause a crash if the
    previous data for those arrays is no longer valid.

    interval: Add a pointer variant to compute_value()
    
    ClutterInterval.compute_value() computes the new value given a progress
    and copies it to a given GValue. Since most of the time we want to pass
    that very same value to another function that copies it again, we should
    have a compute_value() variant that stores that computed value inside
    ClutterInterval and returns a pointer to it. This way we initialize the
    result GValue just once and we never copy it, as long as the Interval
    instance is valid.

    math: Adds an experimental cogl_vector3_* API
    
    This adds a math utility API for handling 3 component, single precision
    float vectors with the following; mostly self explanatory functions:
    
    cogl_vector3_init
    cogl_vector3_init_zero
    cogl_vector3_equal
    cogl_vector3_equal_with_epsilon
    cogl_vector3_copy
    cogl_vector3_free
    cogl_vector3_invert
    cogl_vector3_add
    cogl_vector3_subtract
    cogl_vector3_multiply_scalar
    cogl_vector3_divide_scalar
    cogl_vector3_normalize
    cogl_vector3_magnitude
    cogl_vector3_cross_product
    cogl_vector3_dot_product
    cogl_vector3_distance
    
    Since the API is experimental you will need to define
    COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_API before including cogl.h if you want to use
    the API.

    Stubs out _cogl_xlib_handle_event
    
    This stubs out an xlib event handling mechanism for Cogl. The intention
    is for Clutter to use this to forward all x11 events to Cogl. As we move
    winsys functionality down into Cogl, Cogl will become responsible for
    handling a number of X events: ConfigureNotify events for onscreen
    framebuffers, swap events and Damage events for cogl_x11_texture_pixmap.

    constraints: Add AlignConstraint
    
    AlignConstraint is a simple constraint that keeps an actor's position
    aligned to the width or height of another actor, multiplied by an
    alignment factor.

    configure: Check the result of AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0
    
    The AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0 doesn't automatically cause the configure script
    to fail if the test fails. This wouldn't usually cause any problems
    because we later check for the right glib version using
    PKG_CHECK_MODULES directly. However AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0 is more thorough
    when checking because it also tries to run a program against the
    library to read the version. If the macro fails but the pkg-config
    check passes then nothing will define GLIB_GENMARSHAL and the build
    step will fail in a confusing way.
    
    This adds a check for the result and gives an AC_MSG_ERROR if it
    fails. The glib dependencies have been moved out of CLUTTER_DEPS to
    AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0.

    DragAction is an Action sub-class that provides dragging capabilities to
    any actor. DragAction has:
    
      • drag-begin, drag-motion and drag-end signals, relaying the event
        information like coordinates, button and modifiers to user code;
    
      • drag-threshold property, for delaying the drag start by a given
        amount of pixels;
    
      • drag-handle property, to allow using other actors as the drag
        handle.
    
      • drag-axis property, to allow constraining the dragging to a specific
        axis.
    
    An interactive test demonstrating the various features is also provided.

    cogl-blend-string: Don't split combined blend statements into two
    
    When a single statement is used to specify the factors for both the
    RGB and alpha parts it previously split up the statement into
    two. This works but it ends up unnecessarily using glBlendFuncSeparate
    when glBlendFunc would suffice.
    
    For example, the blend statement
    
     RGBA = ADD(SRC_COLOR*(SRC_COLOR), DST_COLOR*(1-SRC_COLOR))
    
    would get split into the two statements
    
     RGBA = ADD(SRC_COLOR*(SRC_COLOR[RGB]), DST_COLOR*(1-SRC_COLOR[RGB]))
     A    = ADD(SRC_COLOR*(SRC_COLOR[A]), DST_COLOR*(1-SRC_COLOR[A]))
    
    That translates to:
    
     glBlendFuncSeparate (GL_SRC_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR,
                          GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
    
    This patch makes it so that arg_to_gl_blend_factor can handle the
    combined RGBA mask instead. That way the single statement gets
    translated to the equivalent call:
    
     glBlendFunc (GL_SRC_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR);

    cogl-path: Use true copy-on-write semantics
    
    Previously a path copy was implemented such that only the array of
    path nodes was shared with the source and the rest of the data is
    copied. This was so that the copy could avoid a deep copy if the
    source path is appended to because the copy keeps track of its own
    length. This optimisation is probably not worthwhile because it makes
    the copies less cheap. Instead the CoglPath struct now just contains a
    single pointer to a new CoglPathData struct which is separately
    ref-counted. When the path is modified it will be copied if the ref
    count on the data is not 1.

    This adds a simple test for ClutterCairoTexture that draws two
    rectangles to the cairo surface in an idle callback and then verifies
    that they appeared at the right colours in the paint callback. If that
    succeeds then the second time the idle callback is invoked it will
    replace one of the rectangles with a sub region update and the
    following paint callback will again verify the rectangles.

    text: correct caching logic
    
    This patch combines a number of fixes and improvements to the
    layout caching logic in ClutterText.
    
     * Fix: The width must always be set on the PangoLayout when painting.
       This is necessary because the layout aligns in the width, and
       even when we think we are left-aligned, the auto-dir feature
       of PangoLayout may result in right-alignment.
    
     * Fix: We should only ever try to reuse a cached layout based
       on its logical width if layout.width was -1 when computing
       that logical width. If the layout was already ellipsized,
       then comparing the logical width to the new width we are
       trying to wrap to doesn't make sense. (If "abc" ellipsizes
       to a 15-pixel wide "..." for a width of 1 pixel, that doesn't
       mean that we should use "..." for a width of 15 pixels. Maybe
       "abc" itself is 15 pixels wide.)
    
     * Improvement: rather than looking up cached layouts based on the
       input allocation_width/allocation_height, look them up based
       on the actual width/height/ellipsize that we pass to create
       a layout. This is simpler and improves the chance we'll get
       a cache hit when appropriate even if there are small floating
       point differences.
    
    Note because of the first fix this is less aggressive than dd40732
    in caching layouts; get_preferred_width() and painting can't share
    a layout since get_preferred_width() needs to pass a width of -1
    to Pango and painting needs to pass the real width.
    
    The patch has been updated from the clutter-1.2 branch to current
    master; using the profiling instrumentation it is possible to verify
    with test-text-field that the hit/miss counters go from:
    
       Name                                   Total Per Frame
       ----                                   ----- ---------
       Text layout cache hit counter          13    6
       Text layout cache miss counter         11    5
    
    before applying the patch, to:
    
       Name                                   Total Per Frame
       ----                                   ----- ---------
       Text layout cache miss counter         4     2
       Text layout cache hit counter          3     1
    
    after applying the patch.

    Revert "clutter-cairo-texture: Use the new cogl_pixel_buffer API"
    
    This reverts commit 716ec82db8bec57e35d51e8dee5468435fc9e59e.
    
    The Cogl pixel buffer API currently has problems if an atlas texture
    is created or the format needs to be converted. The atlas problem
    doesn't currently show because the atlas rejects BGR textures anyway
    but we may want to change this soon. The problem with format
    conversion would happen under GLES because that does not support BGR
    textures at all so Cogl has to do the conversion. However it doesn't
    currently show either because GLES has no support for buffer objects
    anyway.
    
    It's also questionable whether the patch would give any performance
    benefit because Cairo needs read/write access which implies the buffer
    can't be put in write-optimised memory.

    cogl-framebuffer: Flush journal when creating fbo
    
    Since framebuffer state is not flushed prior to replaying the journal,
    the trick of marking the framebuffer dirty prior to calling
    glBindFramebuffer() doesn't work... the outstanding journal entries
    will get replayed to the newly created framebuffer.
    
    Fix this by flushing the journal as well.

    clutter-cairo-texture: Fix destroying the old texture
    
    In clutter_cairo_texture_create_region it tries to destroy the old
    texture before mapping the PBO by setting the texture on the first
    layer of the material to COGL_INVALID_HANDLE. However it was using the
    material API incorrectly so it ended up showing a warning and doing

    conform: Make gtester run a list of wrappers
    
    Instead of asking gtester to run ./test-conformance directly we now tell
    it to run a list of wrapper scripts. This results in each test being
    spawned in a separate process avoiding leakage of state between tests
    which has been a big problem with the conformance tests for quite a
    while now.

    test-conform-common: Disconnect all paint handlers on the stage
    
    A few of the tests connected to the paint signal but never
    disconnected it. Most of these handlers had a call to g_main_quit in
    them which meant that it could sometimes cause subsequent tests to
    exit after the first frame is painted. Most of the tests don't
    validate any of the results until after a couple of frames have been
    rendered so this ended up skipping out the test entirely.
    
    To workaround this the test setup function now disconnects all
    handlers for the paint signal on the default stage before the test is
    run.

    If the clip stack is empty then _cogl_clip_stack_flush exits
    immediately. This was missing out the assignment of *stencil_used_p at
    the bottom of the function. If a path is then used after the clip is
    cleared then it would think it needs to merge with the clip so the
    stencil would not be cleared correctly.

    clutter-color: Don't directly read the contents of GValue structs
    
    The code for implementing ClutterColor as GParamSpec and the
    color↔string transformation functions were assuming that ClutterColor
    owns the data in the GValue struct and directly reading
    data[0].v_pointer to get a pointer to the color. However ClutterColor
    is actually a boxed type and the format of the data array is meant to
    be internal to GObject so it is not safe to poke around in it
    directly. This patch changes it to use g_value_get_boxed to get the
    pointer.
    
    Also, boxed types allow a NULL value to be stored and not all of the
    code was coping with this. This patch also attempts to fix that.

    ClutterColor has long had a GTypeValueTable struct around and the
    functions defined to be implemented as a fundamental type. However the
    struct was never actually used anywhere and ClutterColor is actually
    defined as a boxed type. This patch removes the table because it is
    very confusing to have code lying around that is not used.

    Implement accessors for the color bits in a framebuffer
    
    Instead of using cogl_get_bitmasks() to query the GL machinery for the
    size of the color bits, we should store the values inside the
    CoglFramebuffer object and query them the first time we set the framebuffer
    as the current one.
    
    Currently, cogl_get_bitmasks() is re-implemented in terms of
    cogl_framebuffer_get_*_bits(). As soon as we are able to expose the
    CoglOnscreen framebuffer object in the public API we'll be able to
    deprecate cogl_get_bitmasks() altogether.

    cogl-texture: Don't attempt to use GL to convert formats under GLES
    
    In commit abe91784c4b I changed cogl-texture so that it would use the
    OpenGL mechanism to specify a different internal texture format from
    the image format so that it can do the conversion instead of
    Cogl. However under GLES the internal format and the image format must
    always be the same and it only supports a limited set of formats. This
    patch changes _cogl_texture_prepare_for_upload so that it does the
    conversion using the cogl bitmap code when compiling for GLES.

    cogl-material: Fix the check to prevent using too many layers
    
    There was a check at the bottom of the loop which sets up the state
    for each of the layers so that it would break from the loop when the
    maximum number of layers is reached. However after doing this it would
    not increment 'i'. 'i' is later used to disable the remaining layers
    so it would end up disabling the last layer it just set up.
    
    This patch moves the check to be part of the loop condition so that
    the check is performed after incrementing 'i'.

    cogl-material: Fix the warning for when too many layers are used
    
    The warning displayed when too many layers are used had an off-by-one
    error so that it would display even if exactly the maximum number is
    used. There was also a missing space at the end of the line in the
    message which looked wrong when displayed on the terminal.

    test-cogl-materials: Add a test using the maximum number of layers
    
    This adds a test which creates a material using the maximum number of
    layers. All of the layers are assigned a white texture except the last
    which is set to red. The default combine mode is used for all of the
    layers so the final fragment should end up red.
    
    Currently Cogl doesn't provide a way to query the maximum number of
    layers so it just uses glGetIntegerv instead. This might cause
    problems on GLES 2 because that adds additional restrictions on the
    number of layers.

    Fix clutter_event_get_coords() for crossing events
    
    The ClutterCrossingEvent data structure contains the coordinates
    of the crossing; they are regularly filed out by Clutter and by
    the backend event processing code. And yet clutter_event_get_coords()
    returns (0, 0) because it thinks that CLUTTER_ENTER and CLUTTER_LEAVE
    events do not have coordinates.

    actor: Make consistent use of the name in error reporting
    
    Whenever we are warning inside ClutterActor we prefer the actor's name
    to its type, if the name is set. The current code is made less readable
    by the use of the ternary operator:
    
      priv->name != NULL ? priv->name : G_OBJECT_TYPE_NAME (self)
    
    This looks like a job for a simple convenience function.

    If a path is copied and then appended to, the copy needs to have the
    last sub path truncated so that it fits in the total path size in case
    the original path was modified. However the path size check was broken
    so if the copied path had more than one sub path it would fail.

    test-cogl-path: Test sub paths and intersections
    
    This changes the original tests so that it splits the original path
    into two sub paths. When adding a new block to the copied path it also
    adds another sub path. This further stresses the path copying
    mechanism and exposes a bug.
    
    It also tests intersections by drawing a self-intersecting path and a
    path with two sub-paths that overlap. Where the path overlaps it
    should be inverted.

    cogl-clip-stack: Use orientation of the polygon to set clip planes
    
    Previously the clip stack code was trying to detect when the
    orientation of the on-screen rectangle had changed by checking if the
    order of the y-coordinates on the left edge was different from the
    order the x-coordinates on the top edge. This doesn't work for some
    rotations which was causing the clip planes to clip the wrong side of
    the line. This patch makes it detect the orientation by calculating
    the signed area which is a standard computer graphics algorithm.

    cogl-path: Don't try to union sub paths
    
    When drawing a path with only a single sub path, Cogl uses the
    'even-odd' fill rule which means that if a part of the path intersects
    with another part then the intersection would be inverted. However
    when combining sub paths it treats them as separate paths and then
    unions them together. This doesn't match the semantics of the even-odd
    rule in SVG and Cairo. This patch makes it so that a new sub path is
    just drawn as another triangle fan so that it will continue to invert
    the stencil buffer. This is also much simpler and more efficient as
    well as being more correct.

    picking: Read the colour value using COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGBA_8888_PRE
    
    In commit c0a553163b I changed the format used to read the picking
    pixel to COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB_888 because it was convenient to avoid
    the premult conversion. However this broke picking on GLES on some
    platforms because for that glReadPixels is only guaranteed to support
    GL_RGBA with GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE. Since the last commit cogl_read_pixels
    will always use that format but it will end up with a conversion back
    to RGB_888. This patch avoids that conversion and avoids the premult
    conversion by reading in RGBA_8888_PRE.

    cogl_read_pixels: Always use GL_RGBA/GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE under GLES
    
    Under GLES glReadPixels is documented to only support GL_RGBA with
    GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE and an implementation specfic format which can be
    fetched with glGet, GL_IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_FORMAT_OES and
    GL_IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_TYPE_OES. This patch makes it always read
    using GL_RGBA and GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE and then convert the results if
    neccessary.
    
    This has some room for improvement because it doesn't attempt to use
    the implementation specific format. Also the conversion is somewhat
    wasteful because there are currently no cogl_bitmap_* functions to
    convert without allocating a new buffer so it ends up doing an
    intermediate copy.

    cogl-bitmap: Fix converting formats with and without alpha channels
    
    _cogl_bitmap_convert_format_and_premult was failing when converting
    from RGBA to RGB and vice versa. _cogl_bitmap_fallback_convert
    converts without altering the premult status so when choosing a new
    format it would copy over the premult bit. However, it did this
    regardless of whether the new format had an alpha channel so when
    converting from RGBA_8888_PRE to RGB_888 it would end up inventing a
    new meaningless format which would be RGB_888_PRE. This patch makes it
    avoid copying the premult flag if the destination has no alpha. It
    doesn't matter if it copies when the source format has no alpha
    because it will always be unset.
    
    _cogl_bitmap_convert_format_and_premult was also breaking when
    converting from RGBA_8888_PRE to RGB_888 because it would think
    RGB_888 is unpremultiplied and try to convert but then
    _cogl_bitmap_fallback_premult wouldn't know how to do the conversion.

    clutter-texture: Remove confusing comments about realization
    
    In 125bded81 some comments were introduced to ClutterTexture
    complaining that it can have a Cogl texture before being
    realized. Clutter always assumes that the single GL context is current
    so there is no need to wait until the actor is realized before setting
    a texture. This patch replaces the comments with clarification that
    this should not be a problem.
    
    The patch also changes the documentation about the realized state in
    various places to clarify that it is acceptable to create any Cogl
    resources before the actor is realized.

    clutter-cairo-texture: Use the new cogl_pixel_buffer API
    
    ClutterCairoTexture now stores the surface image data in a Cogl pixel
    buffer object. When clutter_cairo_texture_create is called the buffer
    is mapped and a new Cairo surface is created to render directly to the
    PBO. When the surface is destroyed the buffer is unmapped and a Cogl
    texture is recreated from the buffer. This should enable slightly
    faster uploads when using Cairo because it avoids having to copy the
    surface data to the texture.

    text: Increase the size of the Layout cache
    
    Currently, each ClutterText caches 3 Pango layouts:
    
      » one for the preferred, unbounded width
      » one for the preferred height for a given width
      » one for the allocated size
    
    Some layout managers do a double pass that could flush the whole cache
    before it has a chance of actually storing relevant data, resulting in
    a continuous series of misses.
    
    We can try to counteract this by doubling the size of the cache, from
    three slots to six. More than six would be pointless, as well as too
    memory consuming; but we might get down to a number between 3 and 6 at
    any later point.

    text: Check generated size of layouts in cache
    
    By comparing the requested size against the computed sized for existing
    Pango layouts we can avoid creating layouts where the requested size
    matches that of a previously computed one.
    
    In particular this optimisation means that when working with a fixed
    positioning based layout (with no constraints on the size of the
    ClutterText) the same PangoLayout can be used to calculate the preferred
    width, height and also the layout used for the actual painting.

    cogl: Implement retained clip stacks
    
    This adds three new internal API functions which can be used to retain
    the clip stack state and restore it later:
    
     _cogl_get_clip_stack
     _cogl_set_clip_stack
     _cogl_clip_stack_copy
    
    The functions are currently internal and not yet used but we may want
    to make them public in future to replace the cogl_clip_stack_save()
    and cogl_clip_stack_restore() APIs.
    
    The get function just returns the handle to the clip stack at the top
    of the stack of stacks and the set function just replaces it.
    
    The copy function makes a cheap copy of an existing stack by taking a
    reference to the top stack entry. This ends up working like a deep
    copy because there is no way to modify entries of a stack but it
    doesn't actually copy the data.

    ClipClipState now stores handles in the list rather than CoglClipStack
    pointers.

    Separate out CoglClipStackState from cogl-clip-stack.c
    
    CoglClipStackState has now been renamed to CoglClipState and is moved
    to a separate file. CoglClipStack now just maintains a stack and
    doesn't worry about the rest of the state. CoglClipStack sill contains
    the code to flush the stack to GL.

    cogl-slip-stack: Store clip window rect entries in Cogl coordinates
    
    When glScissor is called it needs to pass coordinates in GL's
    coordinate space where the origin is the bottom left. Previously this
    conversion was done before storing the window rect in the clip
    stack. However this might make it more difficult if we want to be able
    to grab a handle to a clip stack and use it in different circumstances
    later. This patch moves the coordinate conversion to inside the clip
    state flushing code.

    cogl-clip-stack: Store window rect entries as ints not floats

    cogl-clip-stack: Use reference counted stack entries
    
    The stack is now stored as a list of reference counted entries.
    Instead of using a GList, each entry now contains a link with a
    reference to its parent. The idea is that this would allow copying
    stacks with a shared ancestry.
    
    Previously the code flushed the state by finding the bottom of the
    stack and then applying each entry by walking back up to the top. This
    is slightly harder to do now because the list is no longer
    doubly-linked. However I don't think it matters which order the
    entries are applied so I've just changed it to apply them in reverse
    order.
    
    There was also a restriction that if ever the stencil buffer is used
    then we could no longer use clip planes for any subsequent entries. I
    don't think this makes sense because it should always work as long as
    it doesn't attempt to use the clip planes more than once. I've
    therefore removed the restriction.

    docs: Clean up ClutterActor's long description
    
    The Actor's long description is a bit cluttered; it contains a section
    on the actor's box semantics, on the transformation order and on the
    event handling.
    
    We should use <refsect2> tags to divide the Actor's description into
    logically separated sections.
    
    We should also add a section about the custom Scriptable properties that
    ClutterActor defines, and the special handling of unit-based properties.

    cogl-material: Use CLAMP_TO_EDGE for WRAP_AUTOMATIC unless overriden
    
    CoglMaterial now sets GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE if WRAP_MODE_AUTOMATIC is used
    unless it is overridden when the material is flushed. The primitives
    are still expected to expose repeat semantics so no user visible
    changes are made. The idea is that drawing non-repeated textures is
    the most common case so if we make clamp_to_ege the default then we
    will reduce the number of times we have to override the
    material. Avoiding overrides will become important if the overriding
    mechanism is replaced with one where the primitive is expected to copy
    the material and change that instead.

    tests: Add a conformance test for the wrap modes of a cogl material
    
    This renders a texture using different combinations of wrap modes for
    the s and t coordinates and then verifies that the expected wrapping
    is acheived. The texture is drawn using rectangles, polygons and
    vbos. There is also code to test a rectangle using an atlased texture
    (which should test the manual repeating) however the validation for
    this is currently disabled because it doesn't work.

    cogl-material: Add support for setting the wrap mode for a layer
    
    Previously, Cogl's texture coordinate system was effectively always
    GL_REPEAT so that if an application specifies coordinates outside the
    range 0→1 it would get repeated copies of the texture. It would
    however change the mode to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE if all of the coordinates
    are in the range 0→1 so that in the common case that the whole texture
    is being drawn with linear filtering it will not blend in edge pixels
    from the opposite sides.
    
    This patch adds the option for applications to change the wrap mode
    per layer. There are now three wrap modes: 'repeat', 'clamp-to-edge'
    and 'automatic'. The automatic map mode is the default and it
    implements the previous behaviour. The wrap mode can be changed for
    the s and t coordinates independently. I've tried to make the
    internals support setting the r coordinate but as we don't support 3D
    textures yet I haven't exposed any public API for it.
    
    The texture backends still have a set_wrap_mode virtual but this value
    is intended to be transitory and it will be changed whenever the
    material is flushed (although the backends are expected to cache it so
    that it won't use too many GL calls). In my understanding this value
    was always meant to be transitory and all primitives were meant to set
    the value before drawing. However there were comments suggesting that
    this is not the expected behaviour. In particular the vertex buffer
    drawing code never set a wrap mode so it would end up with whatever
    the texture was previously used for. These issues are now fixed
    because the material will always set the wrap modes.
    
    There is code to manually implement clamp-to-edge for textures that
    can't be hardware repeated. However this doesn't fully work because it
    relies on being able to draw the stretched parts using quads with the
    same values for tx1 and tx2. The texture iteration code doesn't
    support this so it breaks. This is a separate bug and it isn't
    trivially solved.
    
    When flushing a material there are now extra options to set wrap mode
    overrides. The overrides are an array of values for each layer that
    specifies an override for the s, t or r coordinates. The primitives
    use this to implement the automatic wrap mode. cogl_polygon also uses
    it to set GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER mode for its trick to render sliced
    textures. Although this code has been added it looks like the sliced
    trick has been broken for a while and I haven't attempted to fix it
    here.
    
    I've added a constant to represent the maximum number of layers that a
    material supports so that I can size the overrides array. I've set it
    to 32 because as far as I can tell we have that limit imposed anyway
    because the other flush options use a guint32 to store a flag about
    each layer. The overrides array ends up adding 32 bytes to each flush
    options struct which may be a concern.

    Split the wrap mode of _cogl_texture_set_wrap_mode into three
    
    GL supports setting different wrap modes for the s, t and r
    coordinates so we should design the backend interface to support that
    also. The r coordinate is not currently used by any of the backends
    but we might as well have it to make life easier if we ever add
    support for 3D textures.

    cogl: Make private members really hard to accidentally use
    
    CoglColor and CoglMatrix have public declarations with private members
    so that we are free to change the implementation but the structures
    could still be allocated on the stack in applications. However it's
    quite easy not to realise the members are private and then access them
    directly. This patch wraps the members in a macro which redefines the
    symbol name when including the header outside of the clutter source.

    When emitting signals, one can mark arguments as being "static", ie an

    This allows the signal marshalling code to create static GValues, in

    going to blow a lot of cache lines and frak with the CPU branch

    cogl: Support retained paths
    
    This adds three new API calls:
    
      CoglHandle cogl_path_get()
      void cogl_path_set(CoglHandle path)
      CoglHandle cogl_path_copy(CoglHandle path)
    
    All of the fields relating to the path have been moved from the Cogl
    context to a new CoglPath handle type. The cogl context now just
    contains a CoglPath handle. All of the existing path commands
    manipulate the data in the current path handle. cogl_path_new now just
    creates a new path handle and unrefs the old one.
    
    The path handle can be stored for later with cogl_path_get. The path
    can then be copied with cogl_path_copy. Internally it implements
    copy-on-write semantics with an extra optimisation that it will only
    copy the data if the new path is modified, but not if the original
    path is modified. It can do this because the only way to modify a path
    is by appending to it so the copied path is able to store its own path
    length and only render the nodes up to that length. For this to work
    the copied path also needs to keep its own copies of the path extents
    because the parent path may change these by adding nodes.
    
    The clip stack now uses the cogl_path_copy mechanism to store paths in
    the stack instead of directly copying the data. This should save some
    memory and processing time.

    Although cogl_multiply_matrix was consistent with OpenGL, after further

    that it's in the global cogl_ namespace cogl_transform seems more self
    documenting.

    cogl: move cogl_set_source* funcs into cogl.c
    
    Previously cogl_set_source and cogl_set_source_texture were in
    cogl-material.c and the cogl_set_source_color* funcs were in
    cogl-color.c. Originally this was because cogl.c was duplicated between
    the GL and GLES backends and we didn't want to add to the amount of
    duplicated code, but these files have since been consolidated into one
    cogl.c.

    cogl: adds convenience cogl_multiply_matrix function
    
    Quite often it's desirable to be able to multiply the current modelview
    matrix by an arbitrary matrix. Currently though you have to first
    explicitly call cogl_get_modelview_matrix to get the current modelview
    into a temporary variable, then you need to multiply it with your matrix
    using cogl_matrix_multiply and finally use cogl_set_modelview_matrix to
    make the result be the new modelview. This new convenience function lets
    more efficiently skip the first get and last set steps.

    test-cogl-tex-polygon: Actually use the material it creates
    
    test-cogl-tex-polygon creates a separate material so that it can set
    the texture filters. However in the paint functions that use
    cogl_polygon it was calling cogl_set_source_texture which replaces the
    material and ends up always using GL_LINEAR. This patch makes the
    paint functions assume the correct source is set up instead of trying
    to select a new source.

    x11: Use has_allocation() in TfP actor
    
    ClutterX11TexturePixmap calls get_allocation_box() when queueing a
    clipped redraw. If the allocation is not valid, and if we queue a
    lot of redraws in response to a series of damage events, the net
    result is that we spend all our time in a re-layout. We can
    short-circuit this by checking if the actor has a valid allocation, and
    if not, just queue a redraw - the actor will be allocated by the time it
    is going to be painted.

    actor: Add has_allocation() method
    
    Add clutter_actor_has_allocation(), a method meant to be used when
    deciding whether to call clutter_actor_get_allocation_box() or any
    of its wrappers.
    
    The get_allocation_box() method will, in case the allocation is invalid,
    perform a costly re-allocation cycle to ensure that the returned box
    is valid. The has_allocation() method is meant to be used if we have an
    actor calling get_allocation_box() from outside the place where the
    allocation is always guaranteed to be valid.

    Add "homogeneous" mode to ClutterBoxLayout.
    
    Added new "homogeneous" mode to ClutterBoxLayout, that makes layout children
    get all the same size.
    
    This is heavily inspired in the "homogeneous" attribute available in GtkBox,
    but simplified as we don't have padding nor borders in box layout, only
    spacing.
    
    Also added to test-box-layout a key to set/unset homogeneous mode.
    
    * Coding style fixes.
    * Added proper test for homogeneous mode in box layout.
    * Fix in homogeneous mode.

    script: Do not allocate memory when not needed
    
    When printing out the property value during a ClutterScript debug run we
    generate the value's content using g_strdup_value_contents() - though we
    do it unconditionally. The contents might not be printed (they most
    likely won't, actually) and will be freed afterwards. This is
    unnecessary: we can allocate the contents string after checking if we're
    going to print out the debug note, thus avoiding the whole
    allocation/free cycle unless strictly needed.

    Fix errors in keeping track of the stage bounding rectangle
    
    * Add new clutter_geometry_union(), because writing union intersection
      is harder than it looks. Fixes two problems with the inline code in
      clutter_stage_glx_add_redraw_clip().
    
      1) The ->x and ->y of were reassigned to before using them to
         compute the new width and height.
      2) since ClutterGeometry has unsigned width, x + width is unsigned,
         and comparison goes wrong if either rectangle has a negative
         x + width. (We fixed width for GdkRectangle to be signed for GTK+-2.0,
         this is a potent source of bugs.)
    
    * Use in clutter_stage_glx_add_redraw_clip()
    
    * Account for the case where the incoming rectangle is empty, and don't
      end up with the stage being entirely redrawn.
    
    * Account for the case where the stage already has a degenerate
      width and don't end up with redrawing only the new rectangle and not
      the rest of the stage.
    
    The better fix here for the second two problems is to stop using a 0
    width to mean the entire stage, but this should work for now.

    build: Mark --with-json=internal as experimental
    
    The system JSON-GLib installation should be the preferred way of parsing
    JSON in Clutter. The internal copy is limited by re-synchronization from
    upstream, and by the fact that upstream contains a fork of GScanner that
    allows parsing escaped UTF-8. We should warn users compiling Clutter
    with the internal copy, just like we warn about the internal image
    backend.

    build: Require xcomposite
    
    The X11TexturePixmap actor uses XComposite API directly, without guards.
    It has been doing so for a while, against the fact that we do check for
    the XComposite extension - but we don't depend on it. As soon as you try
    building Clutter on X11 without the XComposite extension available all
    hell breaks loose.
    
    The obvious fix is to make Clutter depend on XComposite - basically
    ratifying what's the current state of things.

    Emit a critical warning if features are not initialized
    
    If you forgot to call clutter_init() then you currently end up with a
    warning saying that the stage cannot be initialized because the backend
    does not support multiple stages. Clearly not useful.
    
    We can catch some of the missing initialization in the features API,
    since we will likely end up asking for a feature at some point.

    Add error reporting for create_context() failures
    
    We kind of assume that stuff will break well before during the
    ClutterBackend::create_context() implementation if we fail to create a
    GL context. We do, however, have error reporting in place inside the
    Backend API to catch those cases. Unfortunately, since we switched to
    lazy initialization of the Stage, there can be a case of GL context
    creation failure that still leads to a successful initialization - and a
    segmentation fault later on. This is clearly Not Good™.
    
    Let's try to catch a failure in all the places calling create_context()
    and report back to the user the error in a meaningful way, before
    crashing and burning.

    model: Let get_n_columns() return a sane value
    
    If you call get_n_columns() during the instance initialization phase but
    before set_name()/set_types() have been called, you'll get a (guint) -1.
    This is less than ideal.
    
    If columns haven't been initialized we should just return 0, which was
    the intent of the API since the beginning.

    The int storage, and the initial value of -1, is used as a guard when
    subclassing ClutterListModel to allow the sub-class to call
    clutter_model_set_names() and clutter_model_set_types().
    
    This reverts commit c274118a8f7ed18e5bc703e614a9ea0a7cdb553c.

    This makes it more likely consumers notice invalid unreferences.

    model: Use guint for the n_columns field
    
    clutter_model_get_n_columns is supposed to return a guint, so the
    n_columns field needs to be a guint with the initial value set to 0.

    cogl-texture-2d: Determine format before checking texture support
    
    When entering cogl_texture_2d_new_from_bitmap the internal format can
    be COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY. This was causing _cogl_texture_2d_can_create
    to use an invalid GL format type. Mesa apparently ignores this but it
    was causing errors when Cogl is compiled with debugging under NVidia.

    Fix checks for out-of-bounds coordinates and repeats
    
    Add a return result from CoglTexture.transform_quad_coords_to_gl(),
    so that we can properly determine the nature of repeats in
    the face of GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB, where the returned
    coordinates are not normalized.
    
    The comment "We also work out whether any of the texture
    coordinates are outside the range [0.0,1.0]. We need to do
    this after calling transform_coords_to_gl in case the texture
    backend is munging the coordinates (such as in the sub texture
    backend)." is disregarded and removed, since it's actually
    the virtual coordinates that determine whether we repeat,
    not the GL coordinates.
    
    Warnings about disregarded layers are used in all cases where
    applicable, including for subtextures.

    eglnative: Don't create a context if there already is one
    
    If the EGL context is already created then we shouldn't try to create
    another one. This was causing problems where one context would be
    created from calling _clutter_feature_init and the other was created
    from _clutter_backend_get_features. Cogl would set up its state using
    the first context and then assume the state was still valid when the
    second context became used so blending was not working correctly.
