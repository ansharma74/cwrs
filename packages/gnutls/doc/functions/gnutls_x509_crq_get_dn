@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn} (gnutls_x509_crq_t @var{crq}, char * @var{buf}, size_t * @var{sizeof_buf})
@var{crq}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crq_t}  structure

@var{buf}: a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be @code{NULL} )

@var{sizeof_buf}: initially holds the size of  @code{buf} 

This function will copy the name of the Certificate request subject
to the provided buffer.  The name will be in the form
"C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC 2253. The output string
 @code{buf} will be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate
data.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER}  if the provided buffer is not
long enough, and in that case the * @code{sizeof_buf} will be updated with
the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
