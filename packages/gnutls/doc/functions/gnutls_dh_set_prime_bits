@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{bits})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{bits}: is the number of bits

This function sets the number of bits, for use in a Diffie-Hellman
key exchange.  This is used both in DH ephemeral and DH anonymous
cipher suites.  This will set the minimum size of the prime that
will be used for the handshake.

In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If
a server sends a prime with less bits than that
@code{GNUTLS_E_DH_PRIME_UNACCEPTABLE}  will be returned by the handshake.

Note that values lower than 512 bits may allow decryption of the
exchanged data.

This function has no effect in server side.
