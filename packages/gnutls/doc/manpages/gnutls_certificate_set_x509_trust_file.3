.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " cred ", const char * " cafile ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " type ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * cafile" 12
is a file containing the list of trusted CAs (DER or PEM list)
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function adds the trusted CAs in order to verify client or
server certificates. In case of a client this is not required to
be called if the certificates are not verified using
\fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()\fP.  This function may be called
multiple times.

In case of a server the names of the CAs set here will be sent to
the client if a certificate request is sent. This can be disabled
using \fBgnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence()\fP.

This function can also accept URLs. In that case it
will import all certificates that are marked as trusted. Note
that the supported URLs are the ones indicated by \fBgnutls_url_is_supported()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
number of certificates processed, or a negative error code on
error.
