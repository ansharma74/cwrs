.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t                                             cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_psk_server_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function                                             * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's PSK credentials.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
gnutls_datum_t* key);

 \fIusername\fP contains the actual username.
The  \fIkey\fP must be filled in using the \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.

In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will
assume that the username does not exist.

The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
callback function should return 0 on success, while \-1 indicates
an error.
