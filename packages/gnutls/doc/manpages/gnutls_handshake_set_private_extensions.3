.SH NAME
gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions(gnutls_session_t " session ", int " allow ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "int allow" 12
is an integer (0 or 1)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will enable or disable the use of private cipher
suites (the ones that start with 0xFF).  By default or if  \fIallow\fP is 0 then these cipher suites will not be advertized nor used.

Currently GnuTLS does not include such cipher\-suites or
compression algorithms.

Enabling the private ciphersuites when talking to other than
gnutls servers and clients may cause interoperability problems.
