.SH NAME
gnutls_pubkey_get_openpgp_key_id \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pubkey_get_openpgp_key_id(gnutls_pubkey_t " key ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned char * " output_data ", size_t * " output_data_size ", unsigned int * " subkey ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pubkey_t key" 12
Holds the public key
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be 0 for now
.IP "unsigned char * output_data" 12
will contain the key ID
.IP "size_t * output_data_size" 12
holds the size of output_data (and will be
replaced by the actual size of parameters)
.IP "unsigned int * subkey" 12
Will be non zero if the key ID corresponds to a subkey
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returned the OpenPGP key ID of the corresponding key.
The key is a unique ID that depends on the public
key parameters. 

If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
*output_data_size is updated and \fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP will
be returned.  The output is \fBGNUTLS_OPENPGP_KEYID_SIZE\fP bytes long.
.SH "RETURNS"
In case of failure a negative error code will be
returned, and 0 on success.
.SH "SINCE"
