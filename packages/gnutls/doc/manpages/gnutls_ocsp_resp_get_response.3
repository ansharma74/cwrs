.SH NAME
gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_response \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_response(gnutls_ocsp_resp_t " resp ", gnutls_datum_t * " response_type_oid ", gnutls_datum_t * " response ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_ocsp_resp_t resp" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_ocsp_resp_t\fP structure
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * response_type_oid" 12
newly allocated output buffer with response type OID
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * response" 12
newly allocated output buffer with DER encoded response
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract the response type OID in and the
response data from an OCSP response.  Normally the
 \fIresponse_type_oid\fP is always "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.1" which means the
 \fIresponse\fP should be decoded as a Basic OCSP Response, but
technically other response types could be used.

This function is typically only useful when you want to extract the
response type OID of an response for diagnostic purposes.
Otherwise \fBgnutls_ocsp_resp_import()\fP will decode the basic OCSP
response part and the caller need not worry about that aspect.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
