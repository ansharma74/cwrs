.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t " list ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", const void * " name ", size_t " name_size ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list" 12
The structure of the list
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
A certificate
.IP "const void * name" 12
An identifier for the certificate
.IP "size_t name_size" 12
The size of the identifier
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be 0.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will add the given certificate to the trusted
list and associate it with a name. The certificate will not be
be used for verification with \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt()\fP
but only with \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt()\fP.

In principle this function can be used to set individual "server"
certificates that are trusted by the user for that specific server
but for no other purposes.

The certificate must not be deinitialized during the lifetime
of the trusted list.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.0
