.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_data(gnutls_x509_crl_t " crl ", int " indx ", void * " data ", size_t * " sizeof_data ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t crl" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crl_t\fP structure
.IP "int indx" 12

This function will return the requested extension data in the CRL.
The extension data will be stored as a string in the provided
buffer.

Use \fBgnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_info()\fP to extract the OID and
critical flag.  Use \fBgnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_info()\fP instead,
if you want to get data indexed by the extension OID rather than
sequence.
.SH "RETURNS"
