.SH NAME
gnutls_prf_raw \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_prf_raw(gnutls_session_t " session ", size_t " label_size ", const char * " label ", size_t " seed_size ", const char * " seed ", size_t " outsize ", char * " out ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "size_t label_size" 12
length of the  \fIlabel\fP variable.
.IP "const char * label" 12
label used in PRF computation, typically a short string.
.IP "size_t seed_size" 12
length of the  \fIseed\fP variable.
.IP "const char * seed" 12
optional extra data to seed the PRF with.
.IP "size_t outsize" 12
size of pre\-allocated output buffer to hold the output.
.IP "char * out" 12
pre\-allocated buffer to hold the generated data.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Apply the TLS Pseudo\-Random\-Function (PRF) on the master secret
and the provided data.

The  \fIlabel\fP variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose
for the generated data.  The  \fIseed\fP usually contains data such as the
client and server random, perhaps together with some additional
data that is added to guarantee uniqueness of the output for a
particular purpose.

Because the output is not guaranteed to be unique for a particular
session unless  \fIseed\fP includes the client random and server random
fields (the PRF would output the same data on another connection
resumed from the first one), it is not recommended to use this
function directly.  The \fBgnutls_prf()\fP function seeds the PRF with the
client and server random fields directly, and is recommended if you
want to generate pseudo random data unique for each session.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
