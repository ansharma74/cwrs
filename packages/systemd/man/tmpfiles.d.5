.SH "NAME"
tmpfiles.d \- Configuration for creation, deletion and cleaning of volatile and temporary files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/etc/tmpfiles\&.d/*\&.conf
.PP
/run/tmpfiles\&.d/*\&.conf
.PP
/usr/lib/tmpfiles\&.d/*\&.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemd\-tmpfiles\fR
uses the configuration files from the above directories to describe the creation, cleaning and removal of volatile and temporary files and directories which usually reside in directories such as
/run
or
/tmp\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FORMAT"
.PP
Each configuration file shall be named in the style of
<program>\&.conf\&. Files in
/etc/
override files with the same name in
/usr/lib/
and
/run/\&. Files in
/run/
override files with the same name in
/usr/lib/\&. Packages should install their configuration files in
/usr/lib/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. All configuration files are sorted by their filename in alphabetical order, regardless in which of the directories they reside, to guarantee that a specific configuration file takes precedence over another file with an alphabetically later name\&.
.PP
If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in
/etc/tmpfiles\&.d/
bearing the same file name\&.
.PP
The configuration format is one line per path containing action, path, mode, ownership, age and argument fields:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Type Path        Mode UID  GID  Age Argument
d    /run/user   0755 root root 10d \-
L    /tmp/foobar \-    \-    \-    \-   /dev/null
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Type"
.PP
\fIf\fR
.RS 4
Create a file if it doesn\*(Aqt exist yet (optionally writing a short string into it, if the argument parameter is passed)
.RE
.PP
\fIF\fR
.RS 4
Create or truncate a file (optionally writing a short string into it, if the argument parameter is passed)
.RE
.PP
\fIw\fR
.RS 4
Write the argument parameter to a file, if the file exists\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&. The argument parameter will be written without a trailing newline\&. C\-style backslash escapes are interpreted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fId\fR
.RS 4
Create a directory if it doesn\*(Aqt exist yet
.RE
.PP
\fID\fR
.RS 4
Create or empty a directory
.RE
.PP
\fIp\fR
.RS 4
Create a named pipe (FIFO) if it doesn\*(Aqt exist yet
.RE
.PP
\fIL\fR

Create a symlink if it doesn\*(Aqt exist yet
.RE
.PP
\fIc\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIb\fR
.RS 4
Create a block device node if it doesn\*(Aqt exist yet
.RE
.PP
\fIx\fR
.RS 4
Ignore a path during cleaning\&. Use this type to exclude paths from clean\-up as controlled with the Age parameter\&. Note that lines of this type do not influence the effect of r or R lines\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIX\fR
.RS 4
Ignore a path during cleanup\&. Use this type to prevent path removal as controlled with the Age parameter\&. Note that if path is a directory, content of a directory is not excluded from clean\-up, only directory itself\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIr\fR
.RS 4
Remove a file or directory if it exists\&. This may not be used to remove non\-empty directories, use R for that\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIR\fR
.RS 4
Recursively remove a path and all its subdirectories (if it is a directory)\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIz\fR
.RS 4
Restore SELinux security context label and set ownership and access mode of a file or directory if it exists\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIZ\fR
.RS 4
Recursively restore SELinux security context label and set ownership and access mode of a path and all its subdirectories (if it is a directory)\&. Lines of this type accept shell\-style globs in place of normal path names\&.
.RE
.SS "Mode"
.PP
The file access mode to use when creating this file or directory\&. If omitted or when set to \- the default is used: 0755 for directories, 0644 for all other file objects\&. For z, Z lines if omitted or when set to \- the file access mode will not be modified\&. This parameter is ignored for x, r, R, L lines\&.
.SS "UID, GID"
.PP
The user and group to use for this file or directory\&. This may either be a numeric user/group ID or a user or group name\&. If omitted or when set to \- the default 0 (root) is used\&. For z, Z lines when omitted or when set to \- the file ownership will not be modified\&. These parameters are ignored for x, r, R, L lines\&.
.SS "Age"
.PP
The date field, when set, is used to decide what files to delete when cleaning\&. If a file or directory is older than the current time minus the age field it is deleted\&. The field format is a series of integers each followed by one of the following postfixes for the respective time units:
.PP
\fIs\fR, \fImin\fR, \fIh\fR, \fId\fR, \fIw\fR, \fIms\fR, \fIm\fR, \fIus\fR
.RS 4
.RE
.PP
If multiple integers and units are specified the time values are summed up\&. If an integer is given without a unit, s is assumed\&.
.PP
When the age is set to zero, the files are cleaned unconditionally\&.
.PP
The age field only applies to lines starting with d, D and x\&. If omitted or set to \- no automatic clean\-up is done\&.
.PP
If the age field starts with a tilde character (~) the clean\-up is only applied to files and directories one level inside the directory specified, but not the files and directories immediately inside it\&.
.SS "Argument"
.PP
For L lines determines the destination path of the symlink\&. For c, b determines the major/minor of the device node, with major and minor formatted as integers, separated by :, e\&.g\&. "1:3"\&. For f, F, w may be used to specify a short string that is written to the file, suffixed by a newline\&. Ignored for all other lines\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
