A few units are treated specially by systemd\&. They have special internal semantics and cannot be renamed\&.
.SH "SPECIAL SYSTEM UNITS"
.PP
basic\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit covering early boot\-up\&.
.sp
systemd automatically adds dependencies of the types Requires and After for this target unit to all SysV service units configured for runlevel 1 to 5\&.
.sp
Usually this should pull\-in all sockets, mount points, swap devices and other basic initialization necessary for the general purpose daemons\&. Most normal daemons should have dependencies of type After and Requires on this unit\&.
.RE
.PP
bluetooth\&.target
.RS 4
This target is started automatically as soon as a bluetooth controller is plugged in or becomes available at boot\&.
.RE
.PP
ctrl\-alt\-del\&.target
.RS 4
systemd starts this target whenever Control+Alt+Del is pressed on the console\&. Usually this should be aliased (symlinked) to
reboot\&.target\&.
.RE
.PP
cryptsetup\&.target
.RS 4
A target that pulls in setup services for all encrypted block devices\&.
.RE
.PP
dbus\&.service
.RS 4
A special unit for the D\-Bus system bus\&. As soon as this service is fully started up systemd will connect to it and register its service\&.
.RE
.PP
dbus\&.socket
.RS 4
A special unit for the D\-Bus system bus socket\&. All units with
Type=dbus
automatically gain a dependency on this unit\&.
.RE
.PP
default\&.target
.RS 4
The default unit systemd starts at bootup\&. Usually this should be aliased (symlinked) to
multi\-user\&.target
or
graphical\&.target\&.
.sp
The default unit systemd starts at bootup can be overridden with the
\fIsystemd\&.unit=\fR
kernel command line option\&.
.RE
.PP
display\-manager\&.service
.RS 4
The display manager service\&. Usually this should be aliased (symlinked) to
gdm\&.service
or a similar display manager service\&.
.RE
.PP
emergency\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit that starts an emergency shell on the main console\&. This unit is supposed to be used with the kernel command line option
\fIsystemd\&.unit=\fR
and has otherwise little use\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
A special target unit that is used during the shutdown logic and may be used to pull in late services after all normal services are already terminated and all mounts unmounted\&.
.RE
.PP
getty\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit that pulls in all local TTY
getty
instances\&.
.RE
.PP
graphical\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit for setting up a graphical login screen\&. This pulls in
multi\-user\&.target\&.
.sp
Units that are needed for graphical login shall add Wants dependencies for their unit to this unit (or
multi\-user\&.target) during installation\&.
.RE
.PP
hibernate\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit for hibernating the system\&. This pulls in
sleep\&.target\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
A special target unit for hibernating and suspending the system at the same time\&. This pulls in
sleep\&.target\&.
.RE
.PP
halt\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit for shutting down and halting the system\&.
.sp
Applications wanting to halt the system should start this unit\&.
.RE
.PP
kbrequest\&.target
.RS 4

rescue\&.target\&.
.RE
.PP
kexec\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit for shutting down and rebooting the system via kexec\&.
.sp
Applications wanting to reboot the system with kexec should start this unit\&.
.RE
.PP
local\-fs\&.target
.RS 4
systemd automatically adds dependencies of type After to all mount units that refer to local mount points for this target unit\&. In addition, systemd adds dependencies of type Wants to this target unit for those mounts listed in
/etc/fstab
that have the
\fBauto\fR
and
\fBcomment=systemd\&.mount\fR
mount options set\&.
.RE
.PP
local\-fs\-pre\&.target
.RS 4
This target unit is automatically ordered before all local mount points marked with
\fBauto\fR
(see above)\&. It can be used to execute certain units before all local mounts\&.
.RE
.PP
multi\-user\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit for setting up a multi\-user system (non\-graphical)\&. This is pulled in by
graphical\&.target\&.
.sp
Units that are needed for a multi\-user system shall add Wants dependencies to this unit for their unit during installation\&.
.RE
.PP
network\&.target
.RS 4
systemd automatically adds dependencies of type After for this target unit to all SysV init script service units with an LSB header referring to the
$network
facility\&.
.sp
This unit is supposed to indicate when the network is "up", but it is only very loosely defined what that is supposed to mean\&. Also see
\m[blue]\fBRunning Services After the Network is up\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
nss\-lookup\&.target
.RS 4
A target that should be used as synchronization point for all host/network name service lookups\&. Note that this is independent of user/group name lookups for which
nss\-user\-lookup\&.target
should be used\&. systemd automatically adds dependencies of type After for this target unit to all SysV init script service units with an LSB header referring to the
$named
facility\&.
.RE
.PP
nss\-user\-lookup\&.target
.RS 4
A target that should be used as synchronization point for all user/group name service lookups\&. Note that this is independent of host/network name lookups for which
nss\-lookup\&.target
should be used\&.
.RE
.PP
poweroff\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit for shutting down and powering off the system\&.
.sp
Applications wanting to power off the system should start this unit\&.
.sp
runlevel0\&.target

.RE
.PP
printer\&.target
.RS 4
This target is started automatically as soon as a printer is plugged in or becomes available at boot\&.
.RE
.PP
reboot\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit for shutting down and rebooting the system\&.

.RE
.PP
remote\-fs\&.target
.RS 4
Similar to
local\-fs\&.target, but for remote mount points\&.

$remote_fs
facility\&.
.RE
.PP
remote\-fs\-pre\&.target
.RS 4
This target unit is automatically ordered before all remote mount points marked with
\fBauto\fR
(see above)\&. It can be used to execute certain units before all remote mounts\&.
.RE
.PP

$portmap
facility\&.
.RE
.PP
runlevel2\&.target, runlevel3\&.target, runlevel4\&.target, runlevel5\&.target
.RS 4
These are targets that are called whenever the SysV compatibility code asks for runlevel 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively\&. It is a good idea to make this an alias for (i\&.e\&. symlink to)
multi\-user\&.target
(for runlevel 2) or
graphical\&.target
(the others)\&.
.RE
.PP
shutdown\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit that terminates the services on system shutdown\&.
.sp
Services that shall be terminated on system shutdown shall add Conflicts dependencies to this unit for their service unit, which is implicitly done when
\fIDefaultDependencies=yes\fR
is set (the default)\&.
.sp
systemd automatically adds dependencies of type Conflicts to this target unit for all SysV init script service units that shall be terminated in SysV runlevels 0 or 6\&.
.RE

suspend\&.target,
hibernate\&.target
and
hybrid\-sleep\&.target
and may be used to hook units into the sleep state logic\&.

facility\&.
.RE
.PP
umount\&.target
.RS 4
A special target unit that umounts all mount and automount points on system shutdown\&.
.sp
Mounts that shall be unmounted on system shutdown shall add Conflicts dependencies to this unit for their mount unit, which is implicitly done when
\fIDefaultDependencies=yes\fR
is set (the default)\&.
.RE
.SH "SPECIAL USER UNITS"
.PP
When systemd runs as a user instance, the following special units are available, which have similar definitions as their system counterparts:
default\&.target,
shutdown\&.target,
sockets\&.target
.PP
In addition the following special unit is understood only when systemd runs as service instance:
.PP
exit\&.target
.RS 4
A special service unit for shutting down the user service manager\&.
.sp
Applications wanting to terminate the user service manager should start this unit\&. If systemd receives SIGTERM or SIGINT when running as user service daemon it will start this unit\&.
.sp
Normally, this pulls in
shutdown\&.target
which in turn should be conflicted by all units that want to be shut down on user service manager exit\&.
